"Big Lots Inc. reported earnings results for the nine months ended October 28, 2006. For the period, the company reported net income of $19,746,000 or $0.18 per diluted share on net sales of $3,197,694,000 compared to net loss of $24,740,000 or $0.22 per diluted share on net sales of $3,035,003,000 for the same period a year ago. For the fourth quarter of 2006, the company revised guidance calls for a 3% to 5% comparable store sales increase with total net sales estimated to be in the range of $1,500 million to $1,525 million. The Company expects that the operating income rate as a % of sales will improve compared to last year based on both gross margin rate expansion and operating expense leverage. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates income from continuing operations of $0.62 to $0.67 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to income from continuing operations of $0.33 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005."
