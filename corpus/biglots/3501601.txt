"Big Lots Inc. reported sales results for the fourth quarter, fourteen weeks and full year ended Feb. 3, 2007. For the quarter, the company reported that sales at stores open at least two years, or same-store sales, increased 4.9%. The company said its same-store sales were driven by an increase in the value of the average basket, and benefitted from more productive advertising programs. Furniture same-store sales rose in the low double digits, and hardlines, particularly electronics, posted same-store sales increased in the high single digits. For the full year, retail sales climbed 8.1% to $4.69 billion from $4.34 billion a year earlier, which included one fewer week. Same-store sales increased 4.6%."
