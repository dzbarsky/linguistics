Big Lots Inc. Settles lawsuit over California Store Managers' Overtime Pay.
Big Lots Inc. has agreed to pay $10 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that claimed the Ohio-based retailer did not compensate hundreds of its California store managers for working overtime. The 1,451 store managers who signed on to the lawsuit alleged Big Lots unfairly exempted them from overtime eligibility when they were required to perform clerical and other duties. Green stopped working for the company in 2000, said he expected to receive at least $100,000 from the settlement. Green and the other plaintiffs will get settlements based on a complex formula that calculates their time with the company.
