Big Lots plans store in Dubuque.
Big Lots Inc., the nation's No. 1 close-out retailer, is coming to Dubuque's West Side. The Columbus, Ohio-based chain plans to open a store at the former Eagle Discount Supermarket, 2050 Kennedy Road. Big Lots' close-out concept has caught fire nationwide. The retailer, boasting more than 1,400 stores in 45 states, offers a mix of brand-name and private-label merchandise obtained through manufacturing overruns and returns. Big Lots limits costs by working with manufacturers looking to unload overstock or discontinued items. Merchandise, ranging from toys and electronics to health and beauty products and furniture, is transported to the Big Lots locations weekly, cutting distribution costs.
