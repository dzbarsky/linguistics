Watertown, N.Y.-Based Air Freshener Maker Wins Trademark Case Against Big Lots Inc.
A federal judge has ruled that Big Lots Inc. infringed on a Car Freshner Corp. trademark by selling an air freshener similar to the Watertown company's distinctive tree-shaped product. Thomas J. McAvoy, senior district judge issued a summary judgment April 23 indicating the product Big Lots carried was similar enough to Car-Freshner's to cause confusion among consumers regarding the products. It contended Big Lots sold the item from August to November 2002, when Car-Freshner notified the retailer of its concern. Big Lots then ordered employees to pull the items from its shelves. It also names as a defendant Midwestern Home Products Inc., which court documents indicate is identified as the distributor on the packaging for many of Big Lots' imported products.
