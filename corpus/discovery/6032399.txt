Discovery Communications Eyes Acquisitions.
Discovery Communications, Inc. might look for acquisitions. David Zaslav, CEO of the firm said, The second is really to be opportunistic in terms of expanding geographies or even domestically into add-on acquisitions that may make sense. I think we are going to look at anything. Our core growth is going to come from what we have. We have a lot of growth left here in the US. I think our first look will be in the area of nonfiction, because that really is where our strength is. But we have factories all around the world.
