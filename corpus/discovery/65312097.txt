KKR, THL, Providence To Reportedly Bid For Travel Channel.
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR), Thomas H. Lee Partners, LP (THL) and Providence Equity Partners LLC may place Travel Channel Media; Bloomberg reported citing four sources with knowledge of the situation. The sources stated that companies are in discussions with Discovery Communications Inc to operate the channel, if they succeed with their bid. Partnering with private equity companies will enable Discovery to retain the advertising contracts it retained when Travel Channel was sold to Cox Communication Inc, one of the people said. Discovery cant acquire Travel Channel for tax reasons, Chief Financial Officer Brad Singer said on September 10. Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. and News Corp. are also bidding for Travel Channel, people familiar with the matter said last month. The first rounds of bids were around $800 million, the Financial Times has reported earlier.
