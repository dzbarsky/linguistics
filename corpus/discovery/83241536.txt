Discovery Communications, Inc. and Capcom Mobile Launch Cash Cab Game on App Store.
Discovery Communications and Capcom Mobile announced the availability of the Cash Cab game on the App Store. Based on the hit Discovery Channel game show series, the Cash Cab App for iPhone and iPod Touch features tons of questions, 21 New York City landmarks, the ability to play your own music in-game, and players can now post their favorite scores directly to Facebook. Additionally, question expansion packs are now available from within the App for near limitless replayability. The Cash Cab App uses the Emmy show's signature concept and challenges players to answer a series of progressively difficult questions before they get to their destination. Extending the TV show experience, gamers can keep coming back for more as questions are pulled from subjects as diverse as History, Pop Culture, Language and Science. The app also features a Ride with a Friend feature similar to the Shout Out option featured in the show.
