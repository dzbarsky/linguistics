Fidelity National Financial Inc. Plans to Cut 600 Jobs in October.
After announcing that it cut 1,700 jobs in the third quarter, Fidelity National Financial Inc. announced that it has cut 600 more this month. And as the housing market slump continues to hurt its title insurance business, Fidelity also announced that its top executives have taken pay cuts. Fidelity officials announced that they have been looking at cutbacks all over the company as its business volume declines. By the end of the third quarter, Fidelity had cut about 4,000 jobs in its title insurance field operations mainly outside of Jacksonville since the beginning of 2006, leaving it with 10,800 field employees.
