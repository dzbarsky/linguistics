Fidelity National Financial To Sell Non Core Operations.
Fidelity National Financial, which has hired Bank of America Securities as its adviser to evaluate possible alternatives for its specialty insurance business, is looking to sell off Sedgwick, as well as certain timber holdings. "Sedgwick and specialty insurance are both relatively matured businesses that may attract acquisition opportunities for strategic buyers," said Fidelity Nationals Chairman, Bill Foley at first-quarter earnings conference call. "If we are able to create liquidity from the sale of some of these assets, we would most likely use a large portion of the proceeds to repurchase our stock," he added.
