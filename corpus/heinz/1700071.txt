Heinz Close To Buying HP Foods.
According to sources, H.J. Heinz Co. is near a deal to purchase HP Foods for almost $860 million. The deal is expected to be announced shortly, and would be priced at ?470 million ($860 million) or roughly 11 times HP's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Heinz appeared a surprise bidder because it entered the auction late. In fact, it has had designs on the brands for years. Other bidders for London-based HP Foods included spice maker McCormick & Co., of Sparks, Md., two United Kingdom-based food companies and private-equity firms. One person familiar with the matter said Heinz originally estimated they would cost at least $900 million.
