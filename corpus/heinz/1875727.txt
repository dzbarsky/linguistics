Heinz To Sell off Certain Businesses Described as Non Core.
H.J. Heinz Company announced it plans to focus on three categories where it has unique strengths - Ketchup, Condiments & Sauces, Meals & Snacks, and Infant Nutrition. The company has identified certain non core businesses in its European division and has retained the services of J.P. Morgan & Company and UBS to assist with the potential divestitures of division that include seafood, vegetable and frozen businesses in Europe (including the Petit Navire(R), John West(R) and HAK(R) brands) and the Tegel(R) poultry business in New Zealand. Following these potential divestitures, Heinz Europe would generate annual revenue of $2.5 billion, representing approximately 30% of Heinz's global sales, with leading brands and a streamlined, less costly organization.
