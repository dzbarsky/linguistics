Heinz Sale of European Businesses Attracts Interest.
According to sources, H.J. Heinz Co., the world's biggest ketchup maker, may receive bids from several interested parties for its European frozen and seafood businesses. Potential bidders may include FMCG Investments, led by David Williams, a former Heinz Europe chief executive. Electra Partners Europe Ltd., BC Partners Ltd. and PAI may consider buying all or parts of the business. Heinz last month hired UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to sell its seafood and frozen food brands in Europe, including the HAK vegetable line, Weight Watchers from Heinz and the Linda McCartney brand, to focus on faster-growing businesses such as sauces. Sources said, Heinz may get bids of up to 400 million pounds ($706.1 million) for the food businesses.
