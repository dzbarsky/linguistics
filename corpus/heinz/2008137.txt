"H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ), announced that it has sold The All American Gourmet Company to Luigino's, Inc. for $65 million in cash. Heinz said it expects the transaction to be mildly dilutive to earnings in Fiscal 2001 ($0.02/share) and Fiscal 2002 ($0.04/share), as a result of lost sales and the brands' seasonal nature. The company expects to take a one-time charge of approximately $65 million in the current fiscal year, reflecting a loss on the disposal of the business. The Budget Gourmet line generated about $100 million in revenue. Dorsey & Whitney LLP acted as legal advisor to Luigino's. H.J. Heinz Company completed the sale of The All American Gourmet Company to Luigino's, Inc. on 02/09/2001."
