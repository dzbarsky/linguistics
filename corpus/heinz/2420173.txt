Blackstone On List of Heinz Euro Bidders.
According to sources, buyout firm The Blackstone Group is among bidders who submitted first round offers in the sale of H.J. Heinz Co.'s European seafood, vegetable and frozen food operations. Sources said that Lion Capital, the former European arm of U.S. buyout firm Hicks Muse Tate and Furst, is also believed to have bid. Heinz put the unit, which generates about $1.4 billion in annual sales, up for sale in September as part of a strategy to drive up earnings by focusing on its namesake ketchup and other key businesses such as infant nutrition.
