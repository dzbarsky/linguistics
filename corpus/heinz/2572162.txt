CapVest eyes Heinz Operations.
CapVest Equity Partners, which this week agreed to buy Scandinavia's Findus brand for close to Euros 550m (Pounds 376m), may combine the purchase with some of Heinz's European food operations. CapVest is one of several private equity firms that has looked at Heinz's European frozen food and seafood operations after the US company put them up for sale last year. Heinz's European frozen food business is estimated to be worth Pounds 200m to Pounds 300m while its seafood business is valued at Euros 350m to Euros 500m.
