Heinz Weighs Up Options For European Ops.
H.J. Heinz Co is reconsidering whether to sell all or part of its European frozen food business, which includes the Linda McCartney and Weight Watchers meal brands, after failing to get the price it wanted, reports the Financial Times. Heinz put its frozen food business on the block last year amid an overhaul of its European operations. It had wanted to sell the business for about ?200 million, the report says, adding that bankers now say this price was considered too high by trade and financial buyers, given poor growth rates in the frozen food sector.
