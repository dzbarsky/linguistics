Nestle may Acquire Linda McCartneys Brand.
Nestle is believed to be in talks with Heinz for Linda McCartney's vegetarian food empire. The meat-free meals had been put up for sale by Heinz as part of a wider sell-off of its frozen products business. Neither Heinz nor Nestle were willing to confirm that talks were going on. Heinz said: "We continue to explore options to maximize the value of the frozen foods business." A spokesman for Nestle declined to comment on "market rumors". However, Heinz is believed to be in discussions with Tivall - a subsidiary of Osem, which is part owned by Nestle.
