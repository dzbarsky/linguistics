HJ Heinz Co. Appoints David Woodward as the President of Heinz UK and Ireland.
HJ Heinz Co. has appointed David Woodward, sales director at Procter & Gamble, as the president of Heinz UK and Ireland. He replaces Jane Miller, who stepped down last month after just a year in the role. Last summer, Miller was forced to cut advertising spend completely (MW July 21) following poor sales. Woodward, who takes over on June 26, will also be part of Heinz's European leadership team. He will report to Scott O'Hara, who is Heinz Europe president and chief executive, and executive vice-president of H J Heinz Company. O'Hara has been acting as interim UK president. Miller, who left for personal reasons, was brought in last May after former UK president Stefan Barden was moved to focus on strategy. He has since joined Northern Foods.
