Heinz and Kagome Modify Investment Plans and Affirm Strategic Alliance.
HJ Heinz Co. and Kagome Company Limited affirmed their strategic alliance. Under the alliance, Heinz, a leading global food company, and Kagome, the leader in ketchup and vegetable juices in Japan, are exploring ways to work together to improve their global operations and product portfolios to accelerate sales growth and reduce operating costs. Heinz and Kagome completed a joint study of the development of a North American fruit/vegetable juice business. As a result of this study, the two companies have agreed to continue their joint effort to commercialize opportunities in this market. As the first step, Kagome on its own will develop and introduce the Kagome brand for vegetable-based drinks in North America.
