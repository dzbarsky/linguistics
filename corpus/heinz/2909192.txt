HJ Heinz Co. Plans to Launch Pop Tart-Style Version.
HJ Heinz Co. has announced plans to launch a Pop Tart-style version which is heated in the toaster. The new invention looks set to make beans on toast even more convenient. Wrapped in foil, the baked bean 'sandwich' can be stored in the freezer and takes just one minute to warm up in the toaster or under the grill. Trials of the product will be held this year in New Zealand before it is launched next year in the highly competitive UK market.
