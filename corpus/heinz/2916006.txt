Trian Calls for Heinz to Sell Assets.
A group led by activist investor Nelson Peltz has asked H.J. Heinz Co. to sell more assets and increase its dividend payout ratio and share repurchase. Heinz has said that it will evaluate Peltz's proposals, but added that the company has already strengthened its portfolio, accelerated growth and delivered record cash flow.
