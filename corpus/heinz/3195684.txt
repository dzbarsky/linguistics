Ex-Heinz Workers Vote No on Contract.
The new owner of the former H.J. Heinz Co. plant on the North Side is struggling to get a deal with the employees making soup and baby food there. Members of United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 325 rejected a second contract offer from TreeHouse Foods Inc. by a vote of 255 to 215. The current contract expired earlier this year but union members continue to work under a contract extension. The vote against the deal did not meet the two-thirds majority required to authorize a strikee.
