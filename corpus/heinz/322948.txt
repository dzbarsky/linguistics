Heinz reports its First Quarter Ended July 31, 2002 Results.
HJ Heinz Co. said its first-quarter earnings fell 11 percent as it sought to shore up ketchup and frozen food sales and prepares to shed StarKist tuna, 9-Lives pet food and other brands. The company earned $177.8 million, or 50 cents a share, in the three months ending July 31 compared with $200.5 million, or 57 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding special items, Heinz earned 54 cents a share in the latest quarter. That was a penny a share more than analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had expected. Revenue rose to 6.1 percent to $2.2 billion from $2.08 billion a year ago. But sales volume was down 4.6 percent as it raised prices and spent more money on consumer advertising, rather than promotions, in an attempt to build loyalty in its core brands.
