HJ Heinz Co. Negotiates for Extension Agreement with United Food and Commercial Workers.
HJ Heinz Co. announced that it is in the process of negotiating an extension agreement with United Food and Commercial Workers Local 911. An extension agreement would allow workers to work beyond the three-year contract, which expired at the end of last month. The company is seeking changes in how health and welfare benefits are paid. Heinz wants concessions from its workers before it agrees to a new contract. Both parties have agreed that if the issue has not been resolved during the last bargaining session, they will continue to negotiate.
