ITC Likely To Bid For Patak's.
The Economic Times reported on March 15th that ITC Ltd's foods unit is likely to bid for Patak's, valued at about ?200 million. Heinz, which already has a partnership with Patak's, could also be interested, the paper said, citing unnamed sources. ITC has been approached by Patak's banker, NM Rothschild, the newspaper said. ITC is seen as "exactly the type of company that could be interested in talking to Patak's", the paper said, citing people close to the founding Pathak family. The paper said ITC Foods' chief executive, Ravi Naware, declined comment.
