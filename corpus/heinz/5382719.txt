Heinz to Launch New Special Blend Ketchup.
Heinz is going to launch a premium version of its tomato ketchup called Special Blend ketchup. The new ketchup will be available in shops from mid-April. The Special Blend Tomato Sauce contains a gourmet mix of twelve tomatoes along with spices, sea salt, Demerara sugar, cayenne pepper and lemon juice. This product caters to a growing interest in premium products and more specialist ingredients. However, at GBP 1.75, this sauce is approximately three times the price of standard Heinz ketchup.
