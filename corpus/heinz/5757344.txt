Heinz Considers Campbell "Nice Fit".
The CEO of H. J. Heinz Co said on August 13 that Campbell Soup Co would make a "nice fit", with Heinz although a Heinz spokesman declined to say whether such an arrangement had been given a serious thought. "Campbell is a great company," Heinz Chief Executive William Johnson replied when asked by a shareholder at the Heinz annual meeting about making an offer for Campbell. "Campbell would represent a nice fit with the company. We are always looking for opportunities to expand and grow." Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen declined to say whether Heinz has looked into making an offer for Campbell. A Campbell spokesman also declined specific comment. "As a practice, we don't comment on statements made by other companies and we're not going to comment on any statement made by Heinz at its annual meeting today," said Anthony Sanzio, a spokesman for Campbell.
