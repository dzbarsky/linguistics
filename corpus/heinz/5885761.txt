HJ Heinz Co. Recalls One Batch of Baby Food in Hong Kong as a Precautionary Measure.
HJ Heinz Co. is taking the precautionary measure of recalling one batch (270 cases of only one variety) of baby food in Hong Kong because of trace levels (1.6mg/kg) of melamine. This contrasts to levels of 2500mg/kg found in adulterated milk formula products in China. After extensive testing, all other Heinz varieties were found to be melamine free. This recall is being initiated in conjunction with the Hong Kong authorities. The precautionary action follows new legislation in Hong Kong that sets a limit for Melamine for children under 36 months at 1mg/kg. All other Heinz varieties were found to be free of melamine following widespread testing. Only one Heinz variety is affected with trace levels and is being recalled as a precautionary measure. This variety represents less than 1% of Heinz's baby food sales in Hong Kong. Heinz is co-operating with the Hong Kong authorities.
