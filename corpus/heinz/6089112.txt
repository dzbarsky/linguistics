HJ Heinz Reportedly Eyes Premier Foods.
HJ Heinz Co. has reportedly approached Premier Foods plc over the possible acquisition of the latter. HJ Heinz has refused to comment on reports. Heinz has however indicated that it is on the acquisition hunt. "With a healthy balance sheet and abundant opportunities to explore in both the developed and developing world, we are confident in our ability to execute value-added acquisitions," said Heinz president and CEO William Johnson. A spokesperson for Premier told just-food last month that the company would consider selling off non-core business to raise capital.
