Illumina Launches SNP Assay Panels for Fine Mapping Genetic Variants.
Illumina Inc. announced the commercial availability of two single nucleotide polymorphism based assay panels designed to study genetic variation and function in the MHC region of the human genome. Illumina's new panels represent the industry's first-ever MHC-focused SNP panels for high-throughput, array-based analysis. By conducting high-resolution analysis of the MHC across many samples, life science researchers may be able to determine some of the key genes and genetic variants that lead to disease susceptibility. The MHC Exon-Centric Panel consists of 1228 SNPs in or within 10kb of protein-coding regions (exons), while a companion MHC Mapping Panel includes 1,293 SNPs evenly distributed across the entire region.
