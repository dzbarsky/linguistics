Illumina and Oxagen to Collaborate On Fine Mapping of SNP Loci in Genetic Linkage Regions.
Illumina Inc. and Oxagen Limited announced that they have signed a collaborative, commercial agreement to generate detailed maps of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) clusters in defined chromosomal regions. Under the terms of the agreement Oxagen will provide a collection of SNP loci within linkage regions together with samples from their extensive library of family collection material and information. Illumina will use its BeadArray technology to design functional assays for the SNPs provided and generate several million overall genotype calls from the sample set. Oxagen will retain rights to all genes and novel associations discovered as a result of the study.
