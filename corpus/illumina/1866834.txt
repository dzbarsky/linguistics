Illumina Announces Worldwide Availability of Multi-Sample, Genome-Wide Expression Microarrays for Mouse Genome.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has begun commercial shipment of two new Sentrix(R) BeadChips that enable multi-sample whole-genome or RefSeq-based expression profiling of mouse samples. Probe content for the new BeadChips is based on well-annotated sequence information derived largely from the Mouse Exonic Evidence-Based Oligonucleotide (MEEBO) consortium. The BeadChips enable profiling of over 47,000 mouse RNA transcripts and variants for the purpose of gene discovery, gene function and pathway research, toxicological studies and molecular characterization of disease. Sentrix Mouse Expression BeadChips are priced to dramatically reduce the cost of genome-wide expression analysis and allow researchers to expand the scale of biological experimentation. The new Sentrix BeadChips are part of a complete gene expression portfolio from Illumina that includes both genome-wide and focused-content arrays as well as powerful assays like the DASL(TM) assay, which enables high-multiplex expression profiling of partially
