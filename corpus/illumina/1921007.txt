Illumina Inc. Signs Agreement with Max-planck Institute of Psychiatry.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has signed an agreement with the Max-Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, Germany, to supply Sentrix BeadChips and Infinium assay reagents for a large-scale genotyping study. The study will be performed by MPI's Center for Applied GenoTyping (CAGT) with two experimental goals: 1) to identify genetic variations that potentially predispose individuals to specific disorders such as depression and anxiety; and 2) further determine the impact of genetic variants on disease pathogenesis and response to psychotropic drugs. In the first phase of the project, the MPI researchers, headed by Florian Holsboer, MD, PhD, institute director, will genotype a large sample set using Illumina's Sentrix Human-1 BeadChip. Over 70% of the SNP markers in the Human-1 are located in or very near genes, enabling direct association of SNP markers with target disease phenotypes.
