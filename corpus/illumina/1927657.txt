PARC Team Purchases Illumina Genotyping Solutions for Study of Pharmacogenomics of Cardiovascular Disease.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has signed an agreement with Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute to provide reagents and instrumentation for a groundbreaking study aimed at determining the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms on individual response to statins, a widely used class of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The study is being carried out as part of the NIH-funded research program, Pharmacogenomics and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease. At the end of the current five-year grant period, PARC aims to have identified critical genetic determinants of response to statin therapy that could be used by health care providers to ensure the best cardiovascular outcome and the lowest risk of treatment for each patient.
