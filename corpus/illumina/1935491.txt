PharmacoDesign Purchases Illumina Genotyping Solutions for Pharmacogenomics Research.
Illumina Inc. announced an agreement of sale with PharmacoDesign (PD) for a BeadStation system and whole-genome genotyping arrays and reagents for ongoing pharmacogenomics studies. PharmacoDesign will genotype various Korean populations with the aim of understanding genetic variation and personalizing treatment for optimal clinical outcomes. Under the agreement, Illumina will gain access to biomarkers discovered by PD and will be able to incorporate such markers into proprietary SNP panels under a worldwide, royalty-bearing exclusive license. Initially, PD will utilize Illumina's Sentrix(R) Human-1 BeadChip, which contains over 100,000 SNP markers, 70% of which are located in or very near genes for direct disease association studies.
