Illumina Inc. Signs Multi-Phase Genotyping Services Agreement to Support Colorectal Cancer Researchers.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has signed a multi-phase genotyping services agreement to support colorectal cancer researchers funded by Cancer Research UK. The multi-million dollar agreement extends over several years and includes two major phases. In the first phase of the project, Illumina's service group will conduct dense, whole-genome genotyping for at least 4,000 well-classified colorectal patients and controls. In the second phase, Illumina will genotype over 10,000 samples using a custom, multi-sample BeadChip that will enable analysis of 20,000 SNPs per sample. Both phases will use Illumina's Sentrix(R) Arrays and Infinium(TM) Assay with the option to employ related assay methods.
