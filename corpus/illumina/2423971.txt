Illumina Conducting Large-Scale Poultry Genotyping Project for Aviagen.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has nearly completed the second phase of a large-scale genomics services agreement with Aviagen, to genotype broiler chicken DNA samples. A panel of 3072 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was genotyped during the third quarter in the agreement's first phase. Work is now ongoing to genotype an additional set of 3072 markers against the same 2000 samples used in the original phase. Following data analysis, Aviagen plans to develop a custom panel of 1536 broiler chicken SNPs and validate these markers against a new set of 2000 samples. Illumina is using Sentrix(R) Arrays in conjunction with the Company's GoldenGate(R) assay to conduct the focused genotyping studies for Aviagen. The results of this study and follow-on studies - part of a major genomics initiative by Aviagen -are expected to generate information that will enhance the selective breeding of broiler chickens. Aviagen is also evaluating development of a similar panel to genotype turkeys.
