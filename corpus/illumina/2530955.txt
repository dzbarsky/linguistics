North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System to Use Illumina Whole-Genome Genotyping Solutions to Support Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Illumina Inc. announced that the NIDDK(1) Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Genetics Consortium will utilize the Sentrix(R) HumanHap300 BeadChips and Infinium(TM) assay reagents to genotype over 2000 case-control samples for a genome-wide study designed to help identify genetic variants that increase susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD). Principal Investigator of the Data Coordinating Center, Judy Cho, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine, Section of Gastroenterology at the University of Chicago Hospitals, is leading the IBD study. Dr. Cho and colleagues have assembled a well-characterized collection of disease samples and will perform the data analysis. The genotyping will be performed at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, part of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, under the direction of Peter K. Gregersen, M.D., Head of the Robert S. Boas Center for Genomics and Human Genetics at The Feinstein. One thousand control individuals will be typed as part of the study, and the control g
