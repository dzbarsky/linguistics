Illumina Expands GoldenGate(R) Genotyping Portfolio with Launch of Three Content Products and Reduced-complexity Array Matrix.
Illumina Inc. announced the commercial availability of three new GoldenGate(R) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay panels designed to study genetic variation and help researchers understand how certain genotypes impact disease. Illumina has also introduced a 96-plex Sentrix(R) universal array, further expanding the multiplexing flexibility of custom GoldenGate genotyping. Supplementing the catalog offerings is a new test panel to screen DNA samples for predictive assay quality. GoldenGate Cancer Panel, Illumina's new Cancer SNP Panel can genotype 1421 loci on over 400 genes thought to be related to disease progression. GoldenGate Mouse Linkage Mapping Panels, mouse has evolved as an optimal model system for investigating the genetics of complex disease traits. Illumina has developed two mouse linkage panels for high-throughput and highly informative GoldenGate genotyping. The first panel includes 377 validated SNP loci optimized for the 10 most common inbred mouse strains used in genetic mapping. The s
