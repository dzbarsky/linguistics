Illumina Introduces Two New Sentrix HumanHap Genotyping Beadchips.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has introduced two new Sentrix(R) HumanHap Genotyping BeadChips for conducting genome-wide association research. The first product, the HumanHap550 BeadChip, contains over 550,000 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) markers on a single microarray and provides the most comprehensive genomic coverage of any product currently available. A second product, the HumanHap240S BeadChip, when used in combination with Illumina's existing HumanHap300 BeadChip, enables customers to expand the genomic coverage to the same level provided by the HumanHap550 single-chip solution. The HumanHap240S is available for immediate shipment and the HumanHap550 will be available in the next four weeks. HumanHap BeadChips are powered by the Company's revolutionary Infinium(TM) assay method (see Note), which enables Illumina to select SNPs that have the highest per-marker information value, resulting in comprehensive genomic coverage with fewer SNP markers than competing approaches.
