Illumina to Conduct Large-Scale Genotyping for UK-Based Research Groups, Studying Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has signed a genotyping services agreement to support prostate cancer researchers funded by Cancer Research UK. Under the terms of the agreement, valued at nearly $7 million, Illumina's service group will conduct whole-genome genotyping for at least 4,000 well-classified prostate patients and controls. A second phase will involve development of a custom, 12-sample BeadChip that will enable analysis of 24,000 SNPs per sample and be used to genotype at least 8,000 samples. Both phases will use Illumina's Sentrix(R) BeadChips and Infinium(TM) Assay with the option to employ related assay methods. This is the second large-scale genotyping agreement signed between the two organizations in the last six months. Its structure closely follows a November 2005 agreement under which Illumina is genotyping colorectal cancer samples and controls for Cancer Research UK.
