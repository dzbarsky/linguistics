Illumina and deCODE Form Alliance to Develop and Commercialize DNA-Based Diagnostics.
Illumina Inc. and deCODE genetics Inc. announced the formation of a strategic alliance under which the companies plan to co-develop and commercialize DNA-based diagnostic tests in several major disease areas. The alliance will employ Illumina's platform for high-multiplex single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping to develop tests for gene variants deCODE has previously shown to have impact on the risk of a growing number of common diseases with major public health impact. Under the terms of the agreement, Illumina will gain access to disease-related biomarkers for joint validation as diagnostic panels to be marketed and sold by Illumina on its forthcoming BeadXpress platform. The companies will share development costs and split the profits from sales of the diagnostics tests.
