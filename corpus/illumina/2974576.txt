Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Purchases Large-Scale Illumina System to Genotype Children, Study Childhood Disease and Guide Therapy.
Illumina Inc. announced an agreement with The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia for the purchase of a large-scale system capable of producing 150 million genotypes per day. The Illumina system will be housed at the hospital's new Center for Applied Genomics and will provide a core capability for the Center's unprecedented research goal of ultimately genotyping over 100,000 children. The knowledge gained from these studies is expected to provide significant insight into the genetic basis of common childhood disease, linking genetic variations called SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) with specific illnesses. The results will guide therapy and drive development of new treatments. Including arrays and reagents for the first 30,000 samples, the initial value of the agreement is expected to exceed $25 million. The Center for Applied Genomics will focus on some of the most prevalent diseases of childhood -- asthma, obesity, diabetes and cancer among others -- all of which are thought to involve the contributi
