Illumina Inc. Introduces Sentrix(R) HumanHap650Y Genotyping BeadChip.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has introduced a new Sentrix(R) HumanHap Genotyping BeadChip that extends broad genomic coverage to all four populations studied by the International HapMap Project including the Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria. The Yoruba (see Note) show greater genetic diversity than European and Asian people who experienced population bottlenecks in relatively recent human history. This diversity demands a significantly higher number of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) than less-diverse, younger populations to achieve equivalent genomic coverage. Illumina's HumanHap650Y BeadChip contains over 650,000 SNP markers on a single microarray, providing the most comprehensive genomic coverage and highest data quality of any whole-genome genotyping product currently available. Illumina expects to begin shipping the HumanHap650Y in July. By genotyping DNA samples with the new HumanHap BeadChips, researchers will be better equipped to compare genetic variation between different populations, comprehensi
