Illumina Announces HumanHap550+ and iSelect Infinium(TM) Genotyping Products.
Illumina Inc. announced the immediate availability of two new Infinium genotyping products that provide an unprecedented degree of customization for customers performing whole-genome and focused-content SNP genotyping. The new HumanHap550+ product allows customers to add up to 120,000 custom SNP markers to supplement the standard content provided on the existing HumanHap550 BeadChip, yielding up to 670,000 markers for association studies. For focused-content applications, the new iSelect Infinium product allows customers to create a custom array of up to 60,000 SNP markers per sample with 12 samples per chip. The multi-sample offering will typically be used by researchers who have already performed whole-genome genotyping and/or have narrowed down SNPs of interest to a large, yet focused set of markers relevant to the particular disease they are studying.
