Illumina to Conduct Custom Genotyping for Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has signed a genotyping services agreement with Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C. (J&JPRD). Under the terms of the agreement, Illumina will develop custom SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) content for a multi-sample Sentrix(R) BeadChip. The BeadChip platform enables analysis of 12 samples and up to 60,000 SNPs per sample on a single BeadChip. Illumina expects to genotype thousands of samples provided by J&JPRD using its Infinium(TM) assay, which can provide array-based deployment and genotyping of virtually any SNP on the genome at effectively unlimited multiplex levels while delivering industry-leading data quality. No further details of the agreement were disclosed.
