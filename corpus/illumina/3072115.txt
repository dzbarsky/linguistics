Illumina Inc. Expands Multi Year, Genotyping Services Agreement with Glaxosmithkline plc.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has expanded the scope of its multi-year, genotyping services agreement with Glaxosmithkline plc Under the terms of the new agreement, Illumina will begin to use Sentrix(R) HumanHap550 BeadChips for a series of whole-genome association studies for GSK. The first such study involves genotyping a collection of 2,000 case and control DNA samples provided by GSK for a specific disease, detail for which was not provided. Illumina's HumanHap BeadChips provide broad genomic coverage and the highest per-marker information content of any whole-genome genotyping arrays. The efficient coverage is made possible by Illumina's revolutionary Infinium(TM) assay, which enables intelligent selection and array-based interrogation of virtually any SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) in the human genome.
