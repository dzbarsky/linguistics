Affymetrix Wins Patent Ruling Lawsuit Against Illumina Inc.
Affymetrix Inc. won a court ruling in its contention that it owns a patent at issue in its lawsuit against rival Illumina Inc. U.S. District Judge Joseph Farnan in Wilmington, Del., agreed with Affymetrix and he rejected Illumina's bid to have the patent removed from the case. The patent covers a computer system for analyzing nucleic acid sequences. The judge's ruling, which sided with Affymetrix on most issues, doesn't end the case. Instead, the interpretations establish a baseline for arguments on whether the patents are valid or infringed. Affymetrix filed the suit in 2004 against Illumina. Affymetrix spokesman Wes Conard had no comment on the ruling. Illumina executives didn't return messages seeking comment.
