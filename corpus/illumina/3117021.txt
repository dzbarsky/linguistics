Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School Select Illumina HumanHap300 BeadChips for Whole-Genome Association Study of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
Illumina Inc. announced that investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School will utilize data from Sentrix(R) HumanHap300 BeadChips and Infinium(R) assay reagents to perform a 2,200-sample case/control whole-genome association study of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease. Infinium genotyping on Illumina's genetic analysis system will be conducted at The Broad Institute under the direction of Dr. Stacey Gabriel. Each HumanHap300 BeadChip offers broad genomic coverage and queries over 315,000 tagSNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms with high per-marker statistical value) while delivering industry-leading data quality.
