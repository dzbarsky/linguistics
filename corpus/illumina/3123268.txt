Illumina to Develop iSelect Bovine Beadchip with Three Collaborating Institutions to Genotype over 10,000 Cattle.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has signed a commercial agreement to develop a new multi-sample Bovine BeadChip that uses the Infinium(TM) assay to initially genotype over 10,000 cattle. Illumina's recently released iSelect genotyping BeadChip allows the analysis of twelve samples in parallel with over 48,000 SNP markers per sample, on a single microarray. SNP content will be developed in close collaboration with scientists at three organizations: the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service, the University of Missouri-Columbia and the University of Alberta. The SNP content will utilize the release of the bovine draft sequence and recent genome assembly (Btau 3.0) done at the Baylor College of Medicine. The SNP markers will be used by the participants to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and to selectively breed cattle. Following development of the new Bovine BeadChip and analysis of the initial batch of samples, Illumina plans to offer the new product in early 2007 as a standard
