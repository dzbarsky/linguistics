Illumina Introduces RatRef-12 Whole-Genome Expression BeadChip.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has begun taking orders for a new whole-genome expression product for rat that analyzes twelve samples in parallel on a single BeadChip. Content for the new RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip is derived from the NCBI RefSeq database (Release 16), with over 22,000 rat transcripts represented. The multi-sample format makes it an ideal tool for studies in toxicology, biomarker discovery and disease modeling where many samples need to be processed seamlessly and with high uniformity. With an industry-leading cost per sample of just $100, the RatRef-12 BeadChip will enable researchers to expand their experimental scale within existing project budgets. In addition to its current whole-genome expression products for human and mouse, Illumina is now also offering the RatRef-12 BeadChip as a product or as a service via one of its participating service providers around the globe.
