Illumina Inc. Announces Results from Genotyping Research in Crohn's Disease and Parkinson's Disease (PD).
Illumina Inc. announced that important results from genotyping research in Crohn's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD) using Illumina's Infinium??HumanHap300 BeadChip were published in peer-reviewed journals,ScienceandThe Lancet. Using the HumanHap300 BeadChip, a consortium of United States and Canadian researchers uncovered a breakthrough discovery in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). A second study published in the September 27 online issue ofThe Lancetalso employed the HumanHap300 BeadChip, which completed one of the first large-scale studies of genetic variation in PD. Led by Andrew Singleton, Ph.D., of the National Institute of Aging (NIA), results from the study will help to pave the way towards continued research in PD and other neurological diseases.
