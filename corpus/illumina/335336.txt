Illumina Signs SNP Genotyping Agreement With the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has signed a commercial genotyping agreement with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute to provide single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping services on an extensive SNP collection supplied by the Institute. This pioneering study one of the largest of its type ever conducted is designed to provide a detailed haplotype map of a chromosomal DNA region and could involve millions of genotypes. The results are expected to help define a strategy for developing a haplotype map of the human genome. Under the terms of the agreement, Illumina will develop assays for the SNP collection provided by the Sanger Institute, and use its BeadArray technology to genotype specified SNPs in the sample set. Further details about the agreement were not disclosed.
