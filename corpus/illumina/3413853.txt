Illumina Unveils Industry's Most Comprehensive Whole-Genome DNA Analysis Solution.
Illumina Inc. announced that the next BeadChip in its Infinium??product family will profile over one million diverse genetic variants. The new Human 1M BeadChip combines an unprecedented level of content for both whole-genome (WG) and copy number variation (CNV) analysis, along with additional unique, high-value genomic regions of interest - all on a single microarray chip. Illumina also announced that it plans to introduce the Human 450S BeadChip, which will enable customers using Illumina's HumanHap550 BeadChip, to further extend their genetic studies to include the one million content level. The Human 1M and Human 450S BeadChips will be powered by Illumina's revolutionary Infinium Assay, providing industry-leading data quality, genomic coverage, and intelligent probe selection. Both products are expected to enter the market by the close of the second quarter, 2007. The Human 1M and Human 450S BeadChips will provide high density coverage in greater than 99 % of known genes. The BeadChips will utilize SNP an
