Illumina Inc. Launches the Human HumanCNV370-Duo DNA Analysis Beadchip for Copy Number Variation Research.
Illumina Inc. announced the launch of a new DNA Analysis BeadChip developed in collaboration with deCODE genetics. The new product, called the HumanCNV370-Duo, is the world's first microarray designed to specifically target novel regions of the genome that show copy number variation. Copy number variations can occur when a region within a chromosome or an entire chromosome is randomly amplified or deleted. DNA copy number of certain genomic regions can vary widely from person to person and has already been linked to cancers, congenital disorders, and other common diseases. Priced attractively, the HumanCNV370-Duo will allow researchers to increase the number of samples analyzed, while maintaining unprecedented data quality. Powered by Illumina's Infinium Assay, the HumanCNV370-Duo enables researchers to analyze two samples simultaneously and access novel content for detecting disease-relevant CNV regions. Content found on this BeadChip will also be available on Illumina's Human 1M, a single-chip solution that
