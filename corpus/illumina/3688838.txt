Affymetrix Receives Favorable Verdict in Patent Infringement Case Against Illumina.
Affymetrix Inc. announced that the United States District Court for the District of Delaware returned a verdict in favor of Affymetrix in its patent infringement suit against Illumina Inc. The jury found that Illumina's arrays, scanners, software, and related products infringed on one or more claims of all five of Affymetrix' (5,535,531, 5,795,716, 6,355,432, 6,399,365, and 6,646,243) patents-in-suit. The jury found that the proper royalty rate was 15%, and awarded total damages of more than $16 million for the period of 2002-2005. The next phase of the trial will occur later this year. Affymetrix believes that it will focus on the validity of Affymetrix' patents and whether Illumina's infringement was willful. Affymetrix has also requested injunctive relief in this case, which will be taken up at the conclusion of all phases of the trial.
