Illumina Launches the BeadXpress System Targeting Research and Clinical Development Applications.
Illumina Inc. announced the launch of the BeadXpress(TM)System. Based on its proprietary VeraCode(TM)digital microbead technology, this system represents a significant step forward for research and clinical development applications. Utilizing uniquely inscribed digital microbeads, VeraCode technology provides high-quality data, broad multiplexing capability, and assay flexibility. The two-color laser detection capability of the BeadXpress system is ideally suited for low- to mid multiplex experiments. Using this system, researchers can assay tens to hundreds of analytes in a single sample at one time. Key application areas include biomarker research and validation, pharmaceutical development, industrial testing, agriculture, clinical research, and the development of molecular diagnostic assays.
