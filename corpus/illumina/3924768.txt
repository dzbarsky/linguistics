Illumina Inc. Announces Consolidation of Connecticut Operations.
Illumina Inc. announced that it intends to consolidate its operations in Wallingford, Connecticut into its facilities in San Diego, California. The Wallingford site was originally established in connection with the acquisition of CyVera Corporation and has supported the development and manufacture of the BeadXpress system which was launched in March of 2007. The consolidation is expected to be completed over the course of 2007. Upon completion, all manufacturing and development activities related to the BeadXpress system will continue in San Diego. As a result of the transition, Illumina will incur incremental charges of approximately $2 million. Combined with the expected efficiency gains, these charges are not expected to materially impact the Company's financial performance for 2007.
