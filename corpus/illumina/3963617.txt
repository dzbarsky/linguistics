Illumina Launches Custom Methylation Application.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has added a custom-content methylation product to its growing portfolio of DNA analysis tools. Custom-content design provides researchers with the ultimate flexibility to perform genome-wide methylation profiling specific to individual study goals. Joining Illumina's GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I, the Company's first standard methylation product launched in January 2007, investigators now have the option to select their favorite genes or gene regions to cost-effectively survey up to 1,536 methylation sites of choice across 96 samples simultaneously. Custom methylation adds another degree of integration to analysis with genetic and epigenetic data. Researchers who are interested in expediting the speed and scope of their methylation studies in areas such as cancer, developmental disorders, stem cell, aging, and neurological diseases now have the ability to select specific CpG sites from chosen genes.
