National Genome Research Network Selects Illumina Inc. to Support Genetic Research Projects.
Illumina Inc. announced that National Genome Research Network (NGFN) has selected Illumina's Infinium?HumanCNV370-Duo, HumanHap300-Duo, and HumanHap550 BeadChips to conduct one of the largest genetic research projects to date. Scientists will genotype 8,000 patients and controls using Illumina's tools to investigate genetic variations to better understand underlying causes of 25 complex diseases. Diseases to be studied using Illumina's tools include several mental health diseases such as Bipolar disease and Schizophrenia, in addition to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Alcohol addiction, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and Psoriasis. In addition to Illumina's HumanHap300-Duo and HumanHap550 BeadChips, which can detect up to 317,000 and 550,000 genetic variations on a single BeadChip, respectively, the new HumanCNV370-Duo BeadChip will be used as part of the NGFN study.
