Illumina Unveils iControlDB.
Illumina Inc. announced the launch of iControlDB, the first industry-hosted genotyping control repository available for immediate use by researchers conducting case-control whole-genome association studies. Case-control studies compare groups of patients who already have a disease (case) with a group of patients without the disease (control) to identify risk factors that may contribute to a medical condition. iControlDB provides a cost-efficient and quicker way for investigators to obtain control samples, allowing them to focus resources on genotyping disease samples. Combined with the database of Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP), the scientific community can now access nearly 10,000 control samples that have been donated by researchers using Illumina's technology for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping.
