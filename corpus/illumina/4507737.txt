GenoLogics Announces Bioinformatics Partnership with Illumina.
GenoLogics announced that it has penned an agreement with Illumina Inc. to become a technology partner and participant in IlluminaConnect. GenoLogics will build integrations into Geneus that support Illumina's BeadArray technology platforms and software for both gene expression and genotyping applications. Geneus includes science-specific modules that are purposed for multiple genomics application areas, and is built on an enterprise laboratory information management system (LIMS) platform designed for scientific lab and data management. The most significant benefit from this partnership for customers -this integration to Illumina software will enable customers to interconnect the Illumina technologies in their lab with a LIMS and data management system developed specifically to address gene expression and genotyping workflows and genomics applications. This will allow for smooth data flow from one system to another with an integrating LIMS system that acts as the informatics backbone in one or multiple labs.
