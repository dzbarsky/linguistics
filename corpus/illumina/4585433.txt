Illumina Commences Shipment of the New Human1M DNA Analysis BeadChip.
Illumina Inc. announced that it began shipment of the new Human1M DNA Analysis BeadChip, a solution that contains more than one million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a single chip. In addition to targeting an extensive catalog of known copy number variation (CNV) sites, the Human1M BeadChip contains novel CNV content, developed in collaboration with deCODE genetics and not currently available through any other array or public database. The comprehensive content of the Human1M BeadChip offers the scientific community the highest genomic coverage, power, and value per sample. Powered by the Infinium?assay, which has demonstrated superior performance and delivered robust data to customers, researchers are able to obtain and publish results in record-setting time. The Human1M BeadChip includes a high density of SNPs in coding regions of the human genome, as well as in CNV regions including nonSNPable regions. Increased tagSNP coverage, together with the industry's best SNP uniformity and dense coverag
