Illumina Inc. Opens Genotyping and Gene Expression Analysis Unit.
Illumina Inc. announced the opening of a Genotyping and Gene Expression Analysis Unit at the National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN) in Mexico City. The new unit is part of a 40,000 square foot facility being constructed by INMEGEN and will house a fully-automated Illumina BeadStation. Capable of analyzing thousands of samples per year, the BeadStation is a complete bench-top solution enabling whole-genome and targeted analysis of both DNA and RNA. Using Illumina's BeadArray?technology, powered by the GoldenGate?and Infinium?Assays, INMEGEN scientists will initiate the second phase of the Mexican HapMap project. This large-scale project will include single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and gene expression studies that characterize the genetic variation of the Mexican population. Investigators working on the HapMap initiative, slated for completion in late 2007, will analyze samples from 1,200 individuals in six States of Mexico, including Yucatan, Sonora, Guerrero, Veracruz, Zacatecas, and
