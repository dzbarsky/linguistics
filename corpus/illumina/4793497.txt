Illumina Inc. announced that Cancer Research UK will fund two studies designed to uncover genetic factors linked to the development of lung and ovarian cancers. These studies are part of a dual agreement with UK-based research centers that will total more than 15,500 samples. Both studies will initially use Illumina's Infinium HumanHap550 Genotyping BeadChip, followed by customized analysis using Illumina's iSelect Genotyping BeadChip. These studies mark the third and fourth service projects to be conducted for Cancer Research UK by Illumina's FastTrack Genotyping Services team.
