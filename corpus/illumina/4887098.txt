Illumina Inc. announced that it has agreed to process more than 6,500 samples for researchers of the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) via its FastTrack Genotyping Services. With financial support from the NIDDK, the T1DGC will attempt to identify genes that influence an individual's risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Principal Investigator Stephen Rich, Ph.D., from the University of Virginia and Chair of the T1DGC Steering Committee has chosen to use Illumina's recently launched HumanHap550-Duo BeadChip for the study.
