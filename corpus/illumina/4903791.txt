Illumina Launches MicroRNA Assay for Gene Expression Profiling.
Illumina Inc. launched a MicroRNA Assay for Gene Expression profiling. Priced at $95 per sample, this assay is the only solution available to allow rapid and reproducible miRNA expression profiling at a price less than half that of other commercially available methods. By developing a high-density expression array with content from the miRBase Sequence Database this new tool will help researchers better understand the role microRNAs (miRNA) play in regulating messenger RNA (mRNA). With the new MicroRNA Assay for Gene Expression profiling, coupled with the recently launchedDigital Gene Expression Profiling and Small RNA Analysisapplications, Illumina provides the most comprehensive array and sequencing-based gene expression tool kit in the industry. Using a Digital Gene Expression approach, researchers can discover new miRNAs without prior sequence information. For high-throughput studies that validate and profile miRNA researchers can take advantage of the array-based miRNA solution.
