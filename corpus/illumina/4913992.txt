Illumina Introduces Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Profiling Using Highly Acclaimed Infinium? Assay.
Illumina Inc. introduced a 12-sample Infinium DNA Methylation BeadChip for use in epigenetic research. With this new high-density solution, researchers can assay approximately 27,000 CpG sites per sample, covering more than 14,000 well-annotated genes with single CpG resolution. Content for this panel was derived from genes described in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) Database, and features a core set of protein-coding regions that are consistently annotated and of high quality. In addition, the new array includes more than 1,000 cancer-related genes and 200 CpG sites located within CpG islands found in promoter regions of microRNA (miRNA) genes. Full commercial shipments of Illumina's Infinium DNA Methylation Panel are expected for Q1 2008.
