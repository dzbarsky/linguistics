Biodiscovery Joins Illumina Connect Bioinformatics Program.
BioDiscovery announced that it joined Illumina Connect, a bioinformatics program offered by Illumina Inc., for downstream analysis of microarray data. After collaborating with Illumina, BioDiscovery has successfully created an interface that allows customers using both Illumina's BeadStudio software to seamlessly process their data in BioDiscovery's Nexus CGH advanced copy number analysis software. Nexus CGH is BioDiscovery's platform-independent solution for the analysis and visualization of multiple samples for identification of regions of chromosomal gain and loss in a population, and performing statistical association studies. Nexus CGH can easily handle large projects including those with thousands of Illumina high-density arrays.
