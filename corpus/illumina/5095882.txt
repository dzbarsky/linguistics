Illumina Announces Commercial Release of the Infinium BovineSNP50 BeadChip.
Illumina Inc. launched the Infinium BovineSNP50 BeadChip, a 12-sample genotyping product now available for detecting genetic variation in any breed of cattle. The BovineSNP50 BeadChip features more than 54,000 SNPs evenly spaced across the entire bovine genome. Of these SNPs, 24,000 were discovered using Illumina's Genome Analyzer and are not available on any other commercial array or in any public database. Illumina also recently released the Infinium CanineSNP20 BeadChip, a 22,000 SNP panel developed in collaboration with the Broad Institute and the University of California, Davis. Genotyping on both the BovineSNP50 and CanineSNP20 products is also available as a service through Illumina's FastTrack Genotyping Services group. Commercial release of this chip is expected in Q1 2008.
