Illumina and Genpathway Announce Partnership to Provide Whole-Genome ChIP-Sequencing Services.
Illumina Inc. and Genpathway Inc. announced the formation of a partnership to provide researchers whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing services. Samples are first prepared using Genpathway's FactorPath ChIP assays, and then sequenced by the Genome Analyzer through Illumina's Sequencing Services. Final data analysis is completed by Genpathway using their proprietary software analysis tools. Combined, the Illumina and Genpathway services provide researchers with access to a complete ChIP-sequencing solution for identifying and quantifying transcription factor binding sites across the entire genome. Specifically, the combined services include cell or tissue processing, antibody selection and qualification, ChIP using Genpathway's optimized procedures for greater sensitivity and specificity, ChIP DNA amplification, quality-control steps throughout the assay, Sequencing Services using Illumina's Genome Analyzer, and complete data analysis by Genpathway.
