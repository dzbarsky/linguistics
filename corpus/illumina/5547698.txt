Applied Biosystems, 454 Life Sciences Corporation and Illumina Inc. Join 1000 Genomes Project.
Leaders of the 1000 Genomes Project announced that three firms that have pioneered development of new sequencing technologies have joined the international effort to build the most detailed map to date of human genetic variation as a tool for medical research. The new participants are Applera Corp-Applied Biosystems Group, 454 Life Sciences Corporation and Illumina Inc. Along with their contributions of sequencing capacity, Applied Biosystems, like all other project participants, have agreed to comply with the policies established by the 1000 Genomes Project Steering Committee. Those policies include rapid public release of the data, including project participants having no early access to the data an intellectual property policy that precludes any participants from controlling the information produced by the project, regular progress reporting and coordination of scientific publications with the rest of the consortium.
