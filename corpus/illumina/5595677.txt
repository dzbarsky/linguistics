The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) Selects Illumina Infinium High-Density (HD) DNA Analysis Products to Study 90,000 Samples.
Illumina Inc. announced that researchers participating in a new initiative funded by the Wellcome Trust selected Illumina's Infinium HD BeadChips to analyze 90,000 DNA samples. This new initiative aims to decipher the molecular basis of human disease and includes participation from leading research groups around the globe. Together, researchers at the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) and 12 independent consortia will collect more than 120,000 DNA samples and analyze them for both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs). This new series of genome-wide association studies are collectively the world's largest genetic research initiative conducted to date, and is expected to uncover genetic variants linked to many diseases such as multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and asthma. In addition to 90,000 samples collected from study participants, 6,000 control samples will be collected and analyzed using Illumina's Infinium HD Human1M-Duo BeadChip.
