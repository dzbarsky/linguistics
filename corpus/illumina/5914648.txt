Illumina Launches mRNA-Seq on the Genome Analyzer.
Illumina Inc. announced the broad availability of mRNA-Seq, a new product for full-length, complementary DNA (cDNA) sequencing on the Genome Analyzer. In contrast to tiling and exon arrays, researchers can use mRNA-Seq to obtain a more in-depth, comprehensive view of the transcriptome, revealing aspects previously unseen using array-based or expression sequence tag (EST) technologies. Beta testing for mRNA-Seq was carried out at multiple research facilities, including Andy Fire's Lab at the Stanford University School of Medicine and James Hadfield's lab at Cancer Research UK's-Cambridge Research Institute (CRI). mRNA-Seq, powered by Illumina's sequencing technology and the Genome Analyzer, provides the industry's most robust discovery tool for the profiling of mRNA. mRNA-Seq delivers unbiased and unparalleled information about the transcriptome because it does not require design of probes or primers.
