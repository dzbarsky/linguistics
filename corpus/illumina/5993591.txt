Illumina Inc. Launches the HumanCytoSNP-12 Beadchip.
Illumina Inc. unveiled a new product for Molecular Cytogeneticists: the Infinium(R) High-Density (HD) HumanCytoSNP-12 DNA Analysis BeadChip. The HumanCytoSNP-12 BeadChip contains nearly 300,000 genetic markers per sample that target all known cytogenetic abnormalities found in genes and disease pathways linked to mental retardation, autism, and other common chromosome anomalies. Priced as low as $125 per sample, the HumanCytoSNP-12 BeadChip is part of a complete cytogenetic solution available from Illumina. To complement the HumanCytoSNP-12 BeadChip, Illumina is also releasing a dedicated cytogenetic software package called KaryoStudio. The HumanCytoSNP-12 BeadChip is powered by Illumina's Infinium HD Assay and includes markers that have been hand-selected by Illumina scientists to target specific regions of cytogenetic importance. Deployed on a 12-sample format, researchers for the first time have access to more than 3.6 million genetic markers on one BeadChip. By utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (S
