Illumina Inc. Launches Infinium HD Human660W-Quad BeadChip for Advancing Copy Number Variation Analysis Studies.
Illumina Inc. unveiled a new product for DNA Analysis: the Infinium(R) HD Human660W-Quad BeadChip. This four-sample BeadChip features 2.6 million genetics markers and was developed in collaboration with The Centre for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in the United Kingdom. The Human660W-Quad BeadChip builds on the content from Illumina's HumanHap550+BeadChip to target over 5,000 regions in the human genome known to be associated with copy number variation (CNV). The Human660W-Quad and Human1M-Duo BeadChips are being used by researchers for a new 90,000 sample initiative funded by the Wellcome Trust. This new series of genome-wide association studies is collectively the world's largest genetic research initiative to date, and is expected to uncover more than 120 billion points of genetic information. Infinium HD products dramatically increase sample throughput and reduce handling time in the lab, with industry-leading data quality tha
