Illumina Launches Multi-Sample Indexing for GoldenGate(R) Assay.
Illumina Inc. launched GoldenGate Indexing, a high-throughput genotyping solution that utilizes multi-sample indexing technology. Researchers may now screen up to 16 times as many samples per reaction as the standard GoldenGate Assay, increasing throughput from 288 samples per day to greater than 2000, while decreasing total reagent consumption. This high-quality genotyping system includes automation control and positive sample tracking through an Illumina Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), creating a turnkey solution for low-complexity screening at an affordable cost per sample. The plexity ranges include 96-plex, 192-plex and 384-plex, which are ideal for screening in the livestock and agriculture market as well as for whole-genome association target validation and quality control applications. Livestock geneticists, including Curt Van Tassell of the USDA Agricultural Research Service, worked with Illumina to develop GoldenGate Indexing and are now working on a custom panel for screening lives
