Expression Analysis Purchases Illumina Inc.'s First Illumina Genome Analyzer.
Illumina Inc. announced that Expression Analysis purchased its first Genome Analyzer. With this purchase, Expression Analysis becomes the only CSPro that owns all four of Illumina's genomic research platforms: Genome Analyzer, iScan, BeadStation, and BeadXpress. This means that customers can perform truly integrated genetic analysis studies, from whole-genome to targeted screening. Greater access to next-generation sequencing approaches in mainstream life sciences will help accelerate the overall pace of discovery and enable greater freedom for researchers to go where the biology takes them in their studies.
