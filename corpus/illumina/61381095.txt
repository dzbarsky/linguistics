Genomic Medicine Institute Adds Illumina Inc.'s Seven Additional Illumina Genome Analyzers to Expand Capacity for Asian 100 Genome Project.
Illumina Inc. announced that the Genomic Medicine Institute (GMI) at Seoul National University College of Medicine in Korea, purchased seven additional Illumina Genome AnalyzerIIx sequencing systems, expanding the capacity of their recently established Asian Genome Center to 10 Illumina sequencing systems. The Illumina Genome Analyzer designed for facilities of all sizes, the Illumina Genome Analyzer has been adopted across genome centers worldwide, plus individual research labs, core and service facilities, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Generating over 20 Gigabases of sequence data, the Genome Analyzer offers the highest rate of daily output and the simplest and most user-friendly workflow. The Genome Analyzer also offers the broadest set of supported applications, including those used to profile and discover novel transcripts, to create a high-resolution genome-wide map of DNA-protein binding sites and to sequence entire human genomes to greater than 30x coverage.
