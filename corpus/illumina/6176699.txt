Illumina Releases New Sequencing Chemistry Kits and Complementary Software for its Genome Analyzer System.
Illumina Inc. announced the release of new sequencing chemistry kits and complementary software for its Genome Analyzer system. These new kits and software enable researchers to generate 40% more reads per run and extend read length to greater than 75 base pairs (bp). Also launched is the new Mate Pair Library Preparation Kit, which provides support for generating longer insert paired-end libraries and is complementary to Illumina's existing short-end paired libraries. These new improvements enable researchers to generate 10 to 15 Gigabases (Gb) of high-quality data per run, more than doubling the output previously attainable on the Genome Analyzer. Illumina's unique combination of very high density and long reads allows researchers to economically take on a broad range of projects, such as whole human genome sequencing and de novo sequencing of complex organisms. In addition to the higher output and longer reads afforded by the new kits and software, Illumina's flexible mate pair technique allows researchers
