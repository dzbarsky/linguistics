Kimberly-Clark Introduces the Neat Sheet Family Size.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. now has a larger sibling: The Neat Sheet family size. The Neat Sheet family size is made of the same patented, water-repellent, cloth-like nonwoven fabric as The Neat Sheet regular size but, at 71 square feet, it covers more than twice the area. While large enough for a family and their gear at a soccer game, a picnic or a campsite, The Neat Sheet family size is light enough to be easily tucked away and carried in a tote bag or basket. It is machine washable and may be dried on a clothesline or in a clothes dryer.
