Kimberly-Clark Introduces Kleenex Moist Cloths.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced the North American launch of Kleenex Moist Cloths, the latest innovation from the company's global Kleenex brand. Kleenex Moist Cloths are thick, soft, disposable hand and face cloths created for use around the home. The product provides an innovative solution to an unmet consumer need for a disposable alternative to a washcloth or wet paper towel -- one that is more substantial and easier to use than traditional hand and face wipes. Kleenex Moist Cloths are large and hand-sized (8.5 inches x 8.25 inches) and feature a mild, alcohol-free formulation that is gentle on the skin. The product's unique packaging features high-quality graphics and seven attractive colors. Like Kleenex facial tissue, Kleenex Moist Cloths are designed to blend with home decor so that the carton may be kept out for ready use. A stay-moist seal and snap-tight lid ensure that the cloths remain fresh yet allow for easy, one-hand dispensing.
