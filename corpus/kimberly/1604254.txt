Kimberly-Clark Launches SCOTT(R) Extra Soft Bath Tissue.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announces the introduction of SCOTT Extra Soft, the most significant innovation for the powerhouse SCOTT(R) brand since its debut in 1913. The brand extension demonstrates how the health and hygiene company is using consumer insights to introduce product innovations that further strengthen Kimberly-Clark's leadership in family care. Joining SCOTT 1000 in the bath tissue aisle, the new 600-sheet SCOTT Extra Soft offers consumers a roll with 50 % more sheets than double rolls of other leading brands. Employing Kimberly-Clark's patented UCTAD (Un-creped Through Air Dried) technology, SCOTT Extra Soft delivers a unique textured pattern that provides a thick, soft, long-lasting roll. The technology also uses less fiber than conventional tissue-making processes, enabling the product to have so many sheets while still fitting on standard dispensers.
