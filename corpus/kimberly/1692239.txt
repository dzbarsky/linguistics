Kimberly-Clark to Begin Testing of Generation 2 Radio Frequency Identification Hardware.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced the company will begin formal testing of Generation 2 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) hardware this summer. The Generation 2 hardware provides a universal solution to RFID technology on a global basis, replacing numerous and incompatible systems with one system used worldwide. The Generation 2 RFID hardware to be tested includes tags, readers, printers, and applicators. The tests, scheduled to begin July 6th at Kimberly-Clark's dedicated RFID research lab in Neenah, Wis., will allow the company to determine which hardware is the most compatible with its conveyor, packing, logistics and shipping systems.
