HUGGIES Baby Network has been designed to meet a growing market need. According to a recent study(1) of expectant and new moms, nearly half agree there is no single Web site that currently guides them through the journey of pregnancy into motherhood. In addition, 73% are looking online for fun activities to play with their baby or young child. The new site enhances the emotional connection between mom and baby by providing online tools that assist mom in planning fun activities for her and baby.
