Energy Supply Dispute at Kimberly-Clark's Mobile, Ala., Facility Settled.
Kimberly-Clark Corporation announced that it has received an arbitration ruling that resolves the second of two disputes involving the company's Mobile Ala. operations. As previously reported, the disputes relate to the closure of the company's Mobile pulp mill in 1999 and the supply of energy to the company's tissue mill there through December 2001. Based on the terms of the ruling, the company will record a pretax charge of approximately $27 million for a one-time payment to Mobile Energy Services Company, L.L.C. (MESC). The ruling will not affect energy service or cause energy costs to increase at Mobile in 2002 and beyond. Under applicable accounting rules, the charge will be included in the company's results for 2001 as a subsequent event, reducing previously reported diluted net income of $3.05 per share to $3.02 per share. The charge does not affect previously reported earnings before unusual items of $3.27 per share.
