Kimberly-Clark Profit Down, Sets Restructuring.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. posted lower second-quarter profit, weighed down by income tax expense and liability due to the repatriation of foreign earnings. The company also unveiled a cost-cutting plan which would lead to a net workforce reduction of about 10 percent, or approximately 6,000 employees, while approximately 20 manufacturing facilities, or 17 percent of the company's worldwide total, will be sold or closed, and an additional 4 facilities will be streamlined.
