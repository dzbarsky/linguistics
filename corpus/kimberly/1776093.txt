Kimberly-Clark Introduces New Kleenguard Purple Nitrile Foam Coated Gloves.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced that it has developed a new line of general purpose industrial gloves. Kleenguard Purple Nitrile Foam Coated Gloves provide a high level of wet and dry grip, making them ideal for applications ranging from auto parts assembly and metalworking to warehousing and other industrial uses where tactile sensitivity is required. Unlike work gloves made of leather or other material, Kleenguard Purple Nitrile Foam Coated Gloves provide both excellent dexterity and comfort thanks in part to a breathable, seamless nylon knit backing. The Purple Nitrile Glove Foam Coating on the palm and fingers increases glove durability as well. The new Kleenguard Purple Nitrile Foam Coated Gloves offer the highest rating for abrasion resistance under EN 3881. The gloves' black-and-purple color helps to hide oil and dirt.
