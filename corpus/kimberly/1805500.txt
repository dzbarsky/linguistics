Kimberly-Clark Launches New Poise Panty.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced the launch of Poise Panty, the latest innovation from the company's market-leading Poise brand. Poise Panty is an underwear product designed specifically to help women experiencing light to moderate bladder weakness feel more feminine because it looks, fits and feels like women's underwear. Poise Panty's proprietary cotton-like material not only looks like women's underwear but also stretches and moves with a woman's body to provide enhanced comfort and better fit. The special feminine design and touches such as a scalloped waistband, fitted waist and lavender back thread offers women the feminine look they desire, but cannot find in unisex disposable underwear. Poise Panty provides a discreet solution to bladder weakness that enables women to put their minds at ease.
