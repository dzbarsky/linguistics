Kimberly-Clark Board Authorizes Additional 50 Million Share Repurchase Program.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced that its board of directors has approved the repurchase of 50 million shares of Kimberly-Clark common stock during the next several years. This authorization augments approximately 7 million shares remaining from a June 2004 program. The actual number of shares purchased and the timing of the transactions will depend upon prevailing market conditions. In July, Kimberly-Clark announced its plan to boost its share repurchase target to $1.5 billion, up from its previous plan to buy back at least $1.0 billion worth of KMB shares in 2005. During the first half of this year, K-C bought back 7.7 million shares at a total cost of $501 million. Kimberly-Clark's longer-term objective is to repurchase approximately 2 to 3% of its common stock annually. In 2004, it spent $1.6 billion to repurchase 24.8 million shares. Since 2001, Kimberly-Clark has repurchased approximately 70 million shares and reduced shares outstanding by nearly 57 million to 476.6 million as of June 2005.
