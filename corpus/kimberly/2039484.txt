Announced Merger/Acquisition Transaction - Target: Drypers Corporation, Puerto Rican Operations; Buyer(s): Kimberly-Clark Corp.; Seller(s): Drypers Corporation.
A U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of the business units of Drypers Corporation (OTC: DYPR) to four separate buyers for a total of $69.5 million. The sale proceeds, however, will not cover the $240 million debt the company owed creditors when it filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2000. As part of the approved sale, Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) agreed to acquire the Puerto Rico based operations of Drypers Corporation for an undisclosed price. This deal closed in April 2003 with no change in the terms of the deal. In separate transactions, Drypers also sold its operations in North America, South America, and Malaysia to Associated Hygienic Products LLC, Stronger Corporation, and Navis Capital Partners, respectively. Miller Buckfire & Co., LLC acted as the financial advisor for Drypers Corporation.
