Kimberly-Clark Earnings Fall in second quarter of 2003.
"Kimberly-Clark Corp., the maker of Kleenex and Huggies, said that second-quarter profit fell in part because of weaker-than-expected growth in the sales of diapers and consumer tissue products. Kimberly-Clark said it earned $417.3 million, or 82 cents per share, in the April-June period compared to $424.6 million, or 81 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales for the three months ended June 30 were $3.54 billion compared to $3.41 billion in the year-ago quarter. For the first six months of the year, the company had net income of $815 million, or $1.60 per share, on sales of $7.0 billion. That compares to $863.8 million, or $1.65 per share, on sales of $6.74 billion a year earlier."
