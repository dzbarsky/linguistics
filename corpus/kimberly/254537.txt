Kimberly-Clark Corporation announced an innovative line extension to the Huggies brand: new Huggies Disposable Changing pads. Developed to meet the challenge of diapering an active baby on the go, Huggies Disposable Changing pads offer a clean, convenient changing surface that is instantly available, whether diapering a baby in a public restroom or anywhere away from home. Huggies Disposable Changing pads have a soft, highly absorbent top layer for comfort and a non-slip bottom layer that keeps the pad in place.
