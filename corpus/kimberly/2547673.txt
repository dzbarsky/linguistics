Kimberly-Clark Corp. Introduces Huggies Cleanteam Toddler Toiletries.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced that it is extending its successful baby toiletries into the underserved toddler market with the launch of Huggies Cleanteam bath and body products. The new product line, which features trademarked, letter-shaped characters called Alphamals, helps moms teach toddlers how to keep clean, while having fun at bath time, meal time, potty time, or on-the-go. The company also announces the roll out of 10 additions to its successful line of Huggies Bath & Body toiletries for babies. These innovations -- featuring new formulations, distinctive scents, and colorful, easy-to-use packages -- follow a strong first year for the product line: Huggies toiletries helped sales in the baby and toddler bath and body category grow by 8% in 2005. The launch also helped grow Huggies brand market share in the category to more than 5%.
