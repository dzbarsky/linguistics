Kimberly-Clark Corp. Plans to Close its Neenah South Plant.
Last July, Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced plans to close, sell or streamline about 24 facilities and cut about 10% of its worldwide work force. So far, 13 of the 24 plants already have been notified of their future. In the Fox Cities, the company will close its Neenah South plant later this year while expanding its Cold Spring facility in Neenah. About 30 jobs will be lost in that move locally. The initial phase of the cost-savings plan should be complete by mid-2007.
