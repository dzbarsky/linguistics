Kimberly-Clark plans to close plant; sell another.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. said it plans to close a diaper plant and distribution center and either close or sell another mill, moves that could affect nearly 700 workers. The Dallas-based consumer products company, which manufactures brands such as Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue, said the proposal was part of its plan announced last summer to trim 10 percent of its global work force. The company wants to close its Lakeview diaper and distribution center in Neenah, where about 510 people work, by the end of 2007. Officials said they are working with the union on those closing plans. It hopes to sell its Neenah nonwovens mill, which employs about 165, by the end of the year.
