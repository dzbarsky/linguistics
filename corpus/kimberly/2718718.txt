Kimberly-Clark Launches a Durable Kitchen Towel in Thailand.
Kimberly-Clark Corp., has reinforced its Scott brand by launching a durable kitchen towel in Thailand. The Scott Multi-purpose Wiper entered the Thai market in March after Latin America in 2005. As the majority of consumers are still using cloths to clean their homes rather than paper towels, which are more expensive, the company decided to introduce a durable kitchen towel that can be used up to five times before it is thrown away. After testing the product, 82% of participants showed an interest in buying and eight out of 10 bought the products.
