Kimberly-Clark's Lonsdale Mill Up for Sale.
Kimberly-Clark's Lonsdale mill is up for sale. The paper products giant announced the plant would close last July and will shut its doors for good on July 7, resulting in 70 job losses. The mill made disposable nappies, feminine hygiene and adult care products at the site for 17 years. The company will transfer its nappy production to its Ingleburn factory in Sydney when the plant is closed. The feminine hygiene and adult care products will be imported for sale in Australia. Mill manager Glynn Bartel said there had so far been strong interest in the site. He said much of the interest had been from groups wanting to maintain the 5.2ha property for manufacturing. Expressions of interest on the site, which includes an office, factory and warehouse, close on May 5.
