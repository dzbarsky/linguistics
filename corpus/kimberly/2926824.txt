Kimberly-Clark Begins Shipping Gen2 RFID-tagged Cases of Products to Wal-Mart.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced it has begun shipping Gen2 RFID-tagged cases of product to Wal-Mart. This next step in the implementation of RFID technology is a result of K-C's extensive research and testing on the compatibility of Gen2 hardware and software with conveyor, packaging, logistics and shipping systems in the company's dedicated Auto-ID research lab in Neenah, Wis. Leveraging the accuracy and up-to-the-minute information the Gen2 platform provides, K-C has shipped to Wal-Mart approximately 100,000 cases of Huggies brand diapers and other infant and child care products since March. Using industry-leading Gen2 hardware and software, K-C encoded the RFID tags, placed them on the cases, captured and transferred product data into its supply chain system, and forwarded the data to Wal-Mart, letting them know their product order had been shipped.
