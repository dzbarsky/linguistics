Kimberly-Clark to Sell Neenah Mill.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. plans to eliminate about 150 more jobs in Neenah in the next nine months, including about 50 positions next month in research and engineering. The announcement company adds to the news in March that it plans to close or sell operations in the Neenah area that employ 675 of its 5,000 Wisconsin employees. Dave Dickson, a spokesman for the company, said that another 165 workers would be affected by Kimberly-Clark's plan to sell or close its non-woven products mill in Neenah by the end of 2006. Dickson said he couldn't comment on prospective buyers for that mill, except to say, "There certainly have been some discussions."
