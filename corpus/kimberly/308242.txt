Kimberly-Clark lowers Fourth Quarter 2002 profit expectations.
"Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced that sales and profits would fall in the fourth quarter because of tougher competition for sales of diapers and training pants. Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, said it would earn 72 cents to 76 cents per share in the October-December period excluding unusual costs and gains. That would fall below the company's October forecast of earnings between 82 cents and 86 cents per share and the year-ago results of 82 cents per share after excluding certain costs. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call were expecting 84 cents per share. The company said fourth-quarter sales were likely to be down slightly from a year earlier. The company said it expects sales volumes to rise 3 percent to 5 percent next year due to planned new products and targeted promotions. The company had $14.52 billion in sales last year."
