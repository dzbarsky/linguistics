Kimberly-Clark transfers hundreds of jobs from Utah and Idaho.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. has announced it plans to transfer hundreds of jobs from its plants at Draper, Utah, and Pocatello, Idaho, to a facility in Mexico. Kimberly-Clark said the cost-cutting move will be accomplished through attrition over at least three years with no planned layoffs. The company said Monday that it will transfer 150 to 200 jobs from its plant in the Salt Lake City suburb of Draper that makes disposable medical devices to a facility in Magdalena, Mexico. The Dallas-based company also will transfer about 150 jobs from a plant in Pocatello to the same Magdalena plant. The Utah jobs being transferred pay approximately $11 per hour plus benefits.
