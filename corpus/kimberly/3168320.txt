Kimberly-Clark Corp. Amends By-Laws.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. Board of Directors has amended the company's by-laws to implement a majority voting standard for the election of directors. The board also voted to submit a proposal to shareholders that would eliminate the company's classified board structure. Under the new majority vote standard, which becomes effective immediately and will be used at K-C's Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 26, 2007, directors in uncontested elections will be elected by a majority of votes cast. In contested elections, directors will continue to be elected by plurality vote.
