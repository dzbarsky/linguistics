Kimberly-Clark Introduces Improved Huggies Supreme Diapers.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced its latest innovation to Huggies Supreme diapers. Through its proprietary nonwovens technology, Kimberly-Clark has developed the first-of-its kind diaper with all-around stretch for a more secure and comfortable fit - one of the most important diaper features to parents, according to consumer research. New Huggies Supreme diapers, which are significantly preferred by parents to other premium diaper brands, began hitting store shelves this month across the U.S. in larger diaper sizes. It is the only diaper on the market that offers a new, innovative stretchable outer cover and has a new stretchy waistband providing superior fit and comfort. In addition, stretchy ears and large tabs make fastening the diaper easy and provide a better, overall fit with every change.
