Kimberly-Clark's Neenah Mill Sets Next Phase of Layoffs.
"Kimberly-Clark Corp. is laying off 56 employees in August from its Lakeview diaper mill and distribution center in Neenah, Wis., under the next phase of the plant's eventual closure. The Irving-based paper products maker announced last year that it would close the plant by the end of 2007. The closure will permanently eliminate about 500 jobs."
