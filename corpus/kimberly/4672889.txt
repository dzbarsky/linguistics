Kimberly Clark Seeks Bolt On Acquisitions.
Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO of Kimberly Clark Corp. said that company is looking at smaller acquisitions. We made our global business plan; major acquisitions are not an important part of our strategy. We would look at bolt-on acquisitions and areas where it would align with the growth opportunities in our business. So we've done a small amount of that in healthcare, we'd continue to look at opportunities there and as well as for some aspects of our other businesses around the world, he said.
