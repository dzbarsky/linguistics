Kimberly-Clark Corp. to Settle Sanitary Pad Lawsuit.
Four attorneys announced that they're finally nearing an end in their fight over sanitary pads. Tyco Healthcare sued Kimberly-Clark Corp. last year, claiming Kimberly-Clark was infringing on its trademarked name 'Flexi-Wings' used on Always brand sanitary pads. Tyco Healthcare, a former Tyco International Ltd. unit that recently was spun off as Covidien Ltd., claimed Kimberly-Clark purposefully tried to confuse customers by juxtaposing its trademark name Comfort-Flex next to the word wings on its Kotex brand packaging. In its lawsuit, Tyco reports that Kimberly-Clark began marketing a line of sanitary pads under the Kotex brand with the 'Comfort-Flex' wings designation in the summer of 2006.
