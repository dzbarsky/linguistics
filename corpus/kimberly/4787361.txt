Kimberly-Clark Corp. Launches GoodNites Sleep Boxers and Sleep Shorts.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced the North American launch of GoodNites Sleep Boxers and Sleep Shorts, the first absorbent underpants that look and feel like boxer-style underwear. Based on insights gained from moms and children, Kimberly-Clark designed the GoodNites Sleep Boxers for boys and Sleep Shorts for girls to match popular boxer-style underwear and to offer an odor control feature for added discretion. Together, these attributes help lessen the anxiety and frustration felt by parents and children coping with the issue of bedwetting by providing a feeling of normalcy and self-confidence to those children.
