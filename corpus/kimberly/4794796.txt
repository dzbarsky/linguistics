Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced plans to construct its first manufacturing facility in Russia to support its growing consumer business there and in Eastern Europe. The multi-million dollar facility will be built in phases and will produce personal care and tissue products under the well-known Huggies and Kleenex brands.

The company has placed particular emphasis on Russia and five other key countries that it refers to as BRICIT -- Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, China, India and Turkey. Construction at the site will begin this month with start-up of the facility scheduled for early 2009. The first phase of development will provide for site preparation, construction of manufacturing buildings, offices, warehousing and roads. The facility will be located in Stupino, approximately 60 miles (100 km) southeast from Moscow, and will occupy an area of about 100 acres (40 hectares).
