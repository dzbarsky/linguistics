Kimberly-Clark Mill to Eliminate About 500 Jobs.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced that its Lakeview diaper mill and distribution center in Neenah will end production Dec. 7 when the majority of the mill's remaining 204 employees will be laid off. Some employees will remain until Jan. 31 to help shut down the mill completely. The Irving, Texas-based paper products maker announced last year that it would close the plant by the end of 2007. The phased closure permanently eliminates about 500 jobs. The mill's employees, all of whom will be released before the end of the year, will receive either 60 days of wages and benefits in lieu of notice, or 60 days notice, to ensure compliance with the state law. Affected workers are represented by the United Steelworkers Local 2-482.
