Kimberly-Clark Introduces Second Size for Huggies Convertibles Diaper-Pants.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. announced that it is rolling out its innovative Huggies Convertibles diaper-pants in a second size in the U.S. Available in only one size last year, Huggies Convertibles diaper-pants - a first-of-a-kind product that can be put on like a pant or used like a traditional diaper - have already captured nearly one share point of the $4 billion U.S. diaper market. Developed for active babies, Huggies Convertibles diaper-pants are the first to feature pre-fastened side seams and tabs. Initially available in a single size for babies over 27 pounds, Huggies Convertibles diaper-pants will now be offered in a second size for babies over 22 pounds. The new size will arrive in stores nationally in the U.S. by late summer. Additionally, Huggies Convertibles diaper-pants will be available in both sizes for the first time in Canada this May.
