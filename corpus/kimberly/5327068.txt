Boys & Girls Clubs of America & Kimberly-Clark Corporation Release New Cookbook.
Boys & Girls Clubs Of America (BGCA) along with the Kimberly-Clark Corp. released a new cookbook, Just Add Family: Delicious Recipes for the Entire Family. Just Add Family is a compilation of over 100 favorite family recipes from Boys & Girls Club members and their families; guidelines for creating fun dinnertime activities; and helpful tips for spending quality time together as a family. The cookbook is a part of BGCA's Family PLUS (Parent Leading, Uniting, Serving) initiative, which is sponsored by Kimberly-Clark. Family PLUS is a model for Boys & Girls Clubs wanting to implement family support activities into their Club's programming. To launch the release of Just Add Family, BGCA is hosting a family 'Iron Chef'-type competition in Atlanta. Three Club families, each supplied with ingredients from one of the cookbook's recipes, will turn the ingredients into an appetizing presentation for a panel of guest judges. The winning family will receive a basket of goodies and gift cards that provide for a fun night
