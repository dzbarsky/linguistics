Kimberly-Clark Introduces Disposable Beach Blankets.
Kimberly-Clark Corp. is venturing to the beach with its latest product, which company researchers developed in Neenah. The company has a nationwide rollout set for Neat Sheet, a 30-square-foot, water-resistant, machine-washable ground cloth. Kimberly-Clark is marketing the blue-and-turquoise pads as beach blankets that can serve a variety of other uses and eventually be thrown away. Neat Sheet is priced at $8 each and already is available in some Kohl's food and Target stores in the Milwaukee area.
