BSN Medical On The Block.
Montagu has put BSN Medical on the block, which expects the planned 1.8 billion - 1.9 billion auction to produce its biggest return for investors. There is probably going to be strong competition between strategic buyers, such as 3M Co. and Kimberly Clarke Corp and Apax Partners and Bain Capital, in the auction of BSN. Other companies which may be in the fray include, Cinven Limited, Advent International, Warburg Pincus, Blackstone, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, CVC Capital Partners Ltd and EQT Partners A/S. Montagu received a number of unsolicited approaches for the company, making it appoint Morgan Stanley to conduct a strategic review earlier in 2008. Other groups that could be interested in the sale of BSN include Cardinal Health, Medline and M?lnlycke Health Care Group.
