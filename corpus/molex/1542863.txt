Much Shelist Freed Denenberg Ament & Rubenstein Files a Lawsuit Against Molex Inc. and Certain of its Officers and Directors.
Much Shelist Freed Denenberg Ament & Rubenstein P.C. announced that it has sued Molex Inc. and certain of its officers and directors, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The shareholder lawsuit is on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased the securities of Molex Inc. between April 15, 2004 and February 14, 2005, inclusive. The Complaint alleges that Molex, along with certain of its officers and directors, violated the federal securities laws by issuing a series of materially false and misleading statements to the market. These misstatements have had the effect of artificially inflating the market price of Molex's securities and as a result of this inflation, certain Molex officers and directors were able to sell over $34 million worth of the Company's common stock at inflated prices.
