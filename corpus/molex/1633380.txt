Molex Announces First Gigabit Power over Ethernet Module.
Molex Inc. announced the development of its HyperJack(TM) 1000 Gigabit Power over Ethernet(R) (PoE) module. This innovative product provides PoE management functions embedded within an RJ-45 connector. The multi-port module integrates magnetics that support Ethernet 10/100/1000 and high-performance power management silicon from Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI). To maximize customer design flexibility, the HyperJack 1000 module's fully shielded connector is available in multiple port configurations, including 2-by-4 and 2-by-6. In addition, the PoE module contains up to three TI TPS2384 power management integrated circuits. The versatile, quad-port TPS2384 power manager can support operation over the temperature range -40<o> to +125<o> C for a wide range of commercial, industrial and military uses.
