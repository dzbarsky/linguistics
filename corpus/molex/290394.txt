MuxLink Transceivers from Molex Go the Distance.
Molex Fiber Optics, a division of Molex Incorporated announces two additions to its MuxLink 1300nm CWDM product family. An extended reach version is now available, designed to transmit up to 40km over standard singlemode fiber. A multiple protocol version is also being introduced, which operates over any protocol from 1.0 to 3.2 Gbps per lane and dissipates half the power of current 1300 LR and LX4 modules. Both modules are in the XENPAK form factor. These products will be on display at the following trade shows: ECOC 2002, Booth 21A and NFOEC. An additional feature of the MuxLink-MP transceiver is that it is data rate independent so it can be used for a number of data protocols that operate from 1.0 to 3.2 Gbps per channel including 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Fibre Channel, OC-192, and other proprietary 4-lane applications.
