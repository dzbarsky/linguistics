Molex Expands MX150L Product Line to Handle Higher Currents.
Molex Inc. has expanded the MX150L offering to support large wire AWG applications with 8, 10 and 12 AWG wire-to-wire connectors. These newly available connectors are well-suited for high power, rugged applications including agriculture, construction and marine equipment, as well as recreational vehicles. The integral two-way, silicone-based mat-seal on the mating connectors is specifically designed and tested to IEC IP 67. This feature enables the MX150L product family to exceed waterproof demands as a true sealed connector system tested under submersed conditions in various fluids. The newly added AWG connectors also have high connector forces, increased terminal retention forces and superior electrical and mechanical performance capabilities.
