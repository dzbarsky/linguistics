Molex Inc. Announces SMI Interconnects to Provide Space Saving Solutions for Compact Consumer Devices at NXTcomm 2007.
Molex Inc. announced a new plastic optical fiber data link solution. Based on the Molex small media interconnect SMI, this solution offers seamless, low cost optical data link solutions, as well as space saving qualities through its reduced size and added surface mount capabilities. This new interconnect will be showcased at NXTcomm 2007, booth 3754. As a complete duplex POF solution, the Molex SMI connector and transceiver interconnect system has been adopted by the IEEE 1394 trade committee and is now gaining momentum as the industry standard for POF interconnects. The optical data links have low power consumption and are compatible with IEEE 802.3u fast Ethernet data communications standards, making them an attractive interface for a variety of applications. Available in active device transceivers, adapters, cables and field termination tooling, this system can be employed in consumer electronic devices such as audio, video, home networking and entertainment equipment. They are also well-suited in OEM equi
