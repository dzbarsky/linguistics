Molex Releases CN2610 Terminal Servers with Dual LAN Redundancy.
Molex Inc. has released the CN2610 terminal server, which provides dual LAN ports and a Redundant COM mode for robust network redundancy. Dual LAN Redundancy : Redundancy is an important requirement for many industrial applications, and different solutions have been developed to keep systems running during equipment or software failure. Special watchdog hardware is required to implement hardware redundancy, and a token switching mechanism is required at the software level. Dual LAN redundancy involves two separate physical networks that connect a PC host to the terminal server. On the CN2610, the two networks are connected using two built-in LAN ports. On the PC host, two LAN cards will be required. When dual LAN redundancy is implemented, the PC host will have continuous access to serial devices attached to the CN2610, even if one of the networks fails. Redundant COM : The CN2610's Redundant COM mode is specially designed for redundant LANs between serial devices and a host computer. Using the two built-in L
