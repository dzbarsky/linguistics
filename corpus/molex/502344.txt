Molex Launches MX150 Sealed Connector System.
Sealed Connector System from Molex Inc. is a submersible, environmentally sealed interconnection system designed to withstand harsh conditions. The MX150 Sealed Connector System is shipped in one piece and includes mat and interfacial seals, as well as housing and terminal position assurance (TPA). This pre-assembled design is easy to use and lowers applied costs because it does not require assembly of components and eliminates the need to purchase or handle wire seals. Simply insert a crimped terminal lead and seat the TPA into its final lock position.
