Molex Inc. Adds EtherNet/IP to List of Protocols BradControl(TM) I/O Modules Support to Reliably Connect I/O Devices in Harsh Environments.
Molex Inc. announced the addition of EtherNet/IP(TM) to the industrial protocols supported through its Classic 60mm wide family of BradControl(TM) I/O modules. The BradControl family of I/O modules provides a reliable solution for connecting industrial controllers communicating on industrial networks to I/O devices. BradControl Classic 60mm wide I/O modules already support connections to Modbus TCP (UDP) and now support EtherNet/IP. The module comes in an 8-port 16 channel format with the availability of multiple I/O configurations supporting both PNP and NPN input devices. The I/O module operates as a slave device in the Ethernet control system, gathering signals and data from local field devices. Each BradControl I/O module comes equipped with diagnostic LEDs providing status information on network, power, inputs and outputs. Other features include a built-in 2-port switch for network connections, and a four digit display for addressing and status information. To facilitate input and output device wiring, B
