Molex Introduces Next-Generation KK Terminal to Meet Increasing Electrical Current Requirements.
Molex Inc. announced MarKK(TM) terminal, the next-generation product in the KK? terminal offering. With a technologically advanced design that serves a wide variety of industries, the MarKK crimp terminal features a high-conductivity alloy to offer up to 13.5A per line based on a 2-circuit system. It can be applied to applications in large and small computers, home appliances and consumer electronics, HVAC and diagnostic equipment. Molex's MarKK crimp terminal utilizes a spring-box design for enhanced reliability across an extended temperature range. Its head-and tail-carried design eliminates the need for customers to monitor cutoff dimensions in application tooling, while four independent points of contact help assure a highly reliable interface.
