Molex Inc. Launches BradConnectivity(TM) Micro-change M12 12-Pole Connecter.
Molex Inc. introduced the Micro-Change M12 12-Pole Connection System featuring the convenience and security of an Ultra-Lock(TM) connection in an even higher pin count to handle a broader array of applications such as encoders, resolvers, safety light curtains, trainable sensors and instrumentation. The new Micro-Change M12 12-pole connectors are offered in shielded and unshielded versions. Micro-Change M12-pole cordsets are IP67/68, the Ultra-Lock versions are IP69k rated and all are designed to withstand harsh industrial environments. The cable is UL/CSA approved and halogen free. The product is available as either a M12 standard or Ultra-Lock connection system. In addition the Ultra-Lock 12-pole uses innovative push-to-lock technology to make quick M12 connections by pushing down to connect and pulling up to disconnect. The unique O-ring radial seal is operator independent, so there's no chance of over tightening or under tightening. There is also no twisting or turning like standard threaded connectors. T
