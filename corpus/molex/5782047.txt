Molex's MX150 Cable-Sealed, 1-by-2 Connectors Provide a Valuable Space-Saving Solution for Small-Circuit Applications.
Molex Inc. announced its new MX150(TM) cable-sealed, 1-by-2 connection system designed to support both low-level signal as well as power applications up to 22.0A for small circuit size applications where space is at a premium. Based on the 1.50mm (.059) width ISO blade-type terminal system, the MX150 offers increased sealing reliability for a large range of SAE wire gauges (14 to 22 AWG), as well as metric size wires, while offering low terminal-to-housing retention forces in excess of USCAR-2 requirements. Moreover, it features all-in-one plug and receptacle housings with a pre-assembled interfacial seal and terminal position assurance (TPA).
