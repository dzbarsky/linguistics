Molex Inc. Revised Earnings Guidance for the First Quarter Ended September 30, 2008.
Molex Inc. announced that it is revising its revenue and earnings per share outlook for the first quarter ended September 30, 2008. The company now expects September quarter revenue in the range of $840 million to $845 million, compared with its prior outlook of $860 million to $880 million. The company now expects earnings per share in the range of $0.25 to $0.29. The current outlook includes an estimated restructuring charge of approximately $0.06, which is subject to revision prior to the scheduled earnings release on October 28, 2008. The prior outlook of $0.35 to $0.40 included an estimated restructuring charge of $0.01 per share. The increase in the estimated restructuring charge is due to the Company accelerating a portion of the restructuring program. These changes are due to reduced demand primarily from the telecom/data infrastructure and automotive markets. The industrial and consumer electronic markets are also below the company's original outlook as customers remain cautious in their procurement
