Molex Develops MuxLink 10 Gigabit WWDM Transceivers.
Molex Fiber Optics has announced the development of its MuxLink line of WWDM (Wide Wavelength Division Multiplexed) transceivers. These transceivers are designed to meet the IEEE 802.3ae 10 Gigabit Ethernet 10GBASE-LX4 PMD (Physical Media Dependent sub-layer) standard. They are compliant with the XENPAK multi-source agreement that uses XAUI (10 Gigabit Attachment User Interface) electrical interface. This WWDM LX4 transceiver operates over both installed multimode and singlemode fiber. This transceiver is the only 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard PMD that allows up to 300 meters transmission distance over installed multimode fiber. Molex's MuxLink LX4 modules provide enterprise network manufacturer's maximum flexibility in system configuration. With the same module they can utilize existing multimode fiber infrastructures as well go beyond 10 kilometers over singlemode fiber. To fully maximize end user flexibility, Molex is working on enhanced extended reach versions that will be very cost effective alternatives
