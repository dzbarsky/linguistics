Molex Inc. announced new features added to its BradCommunications(TM) SST(TM) PLC communication modules. BradCommunications SST PLC communication modules provide the interface required for a Rockwell Automation(R) PLC controller to connect to specific industrial fieldbuses. New features have been added to the SST PROFIBUS, Modbus(R) and AS-Interface(R) modules resulting in improved performance and usability. The SST Modbus and PROFIBUS modules for ControlLogix(R) provide users with increased performance and quicker startups by eliminating the ladder logic programming from most applications. The modules also now support Add-On Profiles for easy integration into the ControlLogix system using Rockwell Automation's RSLogix(TM) 5000 software, and Remote Link Library functionality which allows remote configuration and diagnostics using Rockwell Automation Integrated Architecture(TM). Users benefit from faster configuration, better diagnostics and enhanced module data display. The SST AS-Interface module for SLC(TM)
