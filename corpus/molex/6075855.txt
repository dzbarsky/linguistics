Molex Inc. revised earnings guidance for the quarter ending December 31, 2008. The company announced that its revenue and earnings per share for the quarter ending December 31, 2008 will be below the range of estimates provided in its outlook on October 28, 2008, and cautions investors not to rely on those prior estimates. Demand within the company's markets has fallen since the prior outlook was issued. As a result, December quarter revenue is now expected to be in the range of $650 million to $670 million, compared with its prior outlook of $750 to $800 million.
