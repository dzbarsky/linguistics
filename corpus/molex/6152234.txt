Molex Inc. Unveils EdgeLine 12.5 Gbps Edge Card and Coplanar Connectors.
Molex Inc. introduced EdgeLine(TM), a family of one-piece, low-cost connectors supporting high-speed signal transmissions using an card edge interface and a vertical or right angle insertion. Molex's EdgeLine 12.5 Gbps Edge Card and CoPlanar connectors are a flexible and scalable solution for a wide variety of low-to mid-range telecom, computing, and storage applications. As systems become more complex, greater levels of interconnectivity require boards with more layers. This leads to thicker boards, and the EdgeLine Edge Card connectors address this need by offering two versions, both the EdgeLine Coplanar and Edge Card connector were also formatted to meet Telcordia requirements to ensure interoperability for telecom industry standards. Feature high-speed differential performance up to 12.5 Gbps; Offer a 0.80mm (0.031') terminal pitch, accommodate two board thicknesses, 1.57 and 2.36mm (0.062 and 0.093), with a future capability to mate to a 2.00mm (0.079'), to support multiple PCB layers on complex product
