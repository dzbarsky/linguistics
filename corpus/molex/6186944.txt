Molex Inc. Introduces the HyperJack(TM) 1000 Power Over Ethernet Plus (PoE+) Integrated Connector Module (ICM).
Molex Inc. announces an industry first with the introduction of the HyperJack(TM) 1000 Power over Ethernet Plus (PoE+) Integrated Connector Module (ICM) for applications in Gigabit Ethernet switches, routers, hubs and industrial Ethernet switches and routers. This multi-port module integrates magnetics to support Ethernet 10/100/1000 Mbps and embeds the PoE+power management functions in an RJ-45 connector. Molex's integrated HyperJack 1000 PoE+ICM's plug-and-play capabilities help reduce overall engineering costs. The design combines PoE+controller silicon to manage and deliver 30W PoE, coupled with Gigabit PoE+magnetics, thermal management and a high level of protection against ESD, EFT and EMI. Additionally, the HyperJack 1000 PoE+ICM design meets the pending PoETec V2.0 protocol, allowing for easier industry wide adoption. The HyperJack 1000 PoE+ICM features a zero to 70?C operating temperature and two bi-color LEDs (light emitting diodes) per port, giving it the capability to indicate up to eight operatin
