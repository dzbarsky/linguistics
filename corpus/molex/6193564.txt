Molex and Neoconix Introduces HD&S Interposer with Neoconix's PCBeam Interconnect Technology.
Molex Inc. and Neoconix Inc. have developed a flexible copper high-density and speed (HD&S) interposer in a tool-less, easy-to-use configuration. Available now, Molex's FlexBeam(TM) Tool-Less Copper Flex Interposer is a low-profile, flex-to-board interface that provides densities of 1.00mm (0.039') or less in a variety of pin-matrix configurations. The combination of Molex's high speed copper flex assembly integrated with Neoconix's HD&S PCBeam(TM) interposer provides a high-density and high-speed interface for flex-to-PCBA applications. Molex's FlexBeam(TM) Tool-Less Copper Flex Interposer is ideal for use in the server, mass storage, medical imaging, automatic test equipment (ATE), military command and control center, as well as the military munitions markets. It features durable, all-metal spring beams permanently embedded onto an FR-4 substrate, adding a third dimension (z-axis) to traditional two-dimensional PCB processing, in a high-density configuration.
