Molex Eyes Small Acquisitions.
Molex Inc. said that the company is looking for smaller acquisitions. Dave Johnson, Molex, EVP and CFO, said: We intend to maintain the dividend, there's been no discussions at all about any change there, we've slowed down the stock buy back, and we'll take a wait and see attitude on that. In terms of acquisitions we are still looking at some smaller what we think are highly impactful acquisitions for us, but we are not looking at any large acquisitions at this time.
