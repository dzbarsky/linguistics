Molex Inc. Announces the Addition of the BradCommunications(TM) eNetMeter(TM).
Molex Inc. announced the addition of the BradCommunications(TM) eNetMeter(TM) for DeviceNet to its line of diagnostic tools. The BradCommunications eNetMeter DN is a passive device that continuously monitors a DeviceNet network and sends the information over Ethernet to a PLC or PC monitoring system. The information can be read directly by an EtherNet/IP master. Optionally, data can be accessed through a DLL interface, an OPC server or the BradCommunications NetAlytix(TM) software. NetAlytix is a PC-based software which provides an easy-to-use graphical display of network data. Instant flagging of errors and marginal conditions along with pop-up tips provide guidance on possible causes of errors and potential corrective action. eNetMeter DN provides extremely accurate measurements of the network parameters using high-speed sampling. By comparing acceptable base measurements of a 'good' network, it can help predict imminent failures down to individual devices. Measurements can be used in such a way, that when
