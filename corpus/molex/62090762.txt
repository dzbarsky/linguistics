Molex Inc. Prepares Mediation Plan to Resolve Labour Conflict for French Site.
Molex Inc. is elaborating, together with the French government, a mediation plan to resolve the labour conflict at its plant in Villemur-sur-Tarn, southwestern France, due to close down by end-October. The plan should facilitate the negotiation with the workers' representatives regarding the social measures which will help the 287 employees of the site. In the meantime, the plant will remain closed because of the continuous violence threats made by the trade unions and workers. The French court in Toulouse has ordered to the workers' representatives to stop any hindrance to working freedom at the facility, where production has been suspended since July 7, 2009.
