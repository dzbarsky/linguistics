Molex In Talks To Sell Villemur Sur Tarn Site.
Christian Estrosi, Industry Minister of France said that the management of Molex Inc. has agreed to start talks with a foreign potential buyer for its site in Villemur-sur-Tarn, southern France. Marcus Kerriou, Molex's HR vice-chairman said that the firm will negotiate with a company interested in the industrial facility. It was reported that Mr. Estrosi has urged Molex managers to ensure a transition period of 18 to 24 months with a partial continuation of activities in order to gain time for the diversification of the factory. Despite the appeal, the firm remains determined to close the site in October.
