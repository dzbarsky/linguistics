Molex Inc. to Cut 100 Workers.
Molex Inc. will enforce compulsory redundancies after fewer than the 100 workers it hoped to lay off applied for a voluntary package. Workers based in the Shannon Free Zone, were told last month that 100 people, one-quarter of the entire workforce, would be laid off, while remaining staff at the plant would have to take a 5% cut in pay.
