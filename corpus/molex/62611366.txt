Molex Inc. Introduces 1.27mm Pitch Picoflex? SMT Latched Header.
Molex Inc. introduced the new Picoflex? SMT Header with positive retention latches to provide a robust and reliable wire-to-board connection with increased retention force for rugged applications and high-vibration environments. Adding to Molex's already extensive range of Picoflex connectors, which are suitable for many high-density applications where space is at a premium and power and signal are required, these more rugged versions are suited to a variety of demanding applications for the industrial, automotive, medical and multimedia industries. Standard interface design, making the Molex Picoflex surface-mount latched header backward compatible and able to mate with existing Picoflex receptacles. High-profile polarizing peg, which avoids mismating of the header and receptacle and also acts as a lead-in to aid assembly. Polyphthalamide (PPA) housing material enables the header to tolerate reflow temperatures of up to +260?C. Optional gold plating, as opposed to the standard tin plating, which allows for e
