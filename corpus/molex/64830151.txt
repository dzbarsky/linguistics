Molex Announces LED Offering for Government, Commercial, and Residential Construction.
Molex Incorporated introduced to the government, commercial and residential construction markets the company's new series of patent-pending SSL products, the Transcend(TM) Lighting Series, which will be sold exclusively by Leviton Manufacturing Company Inc. in North America. The innovative new products are small, interchangeable modules, which address some of the barriers to widespread adoption of LED technology, including precise heat and current management and the necessary optical design for superior illumination. The unique, sustainable format allows electrical and lighting contractors on residential and commercial sites to use Transcend LED lights in existing fixtures-from decorative wall sconces to recessed cans and track lights-all while meeting code requirements. The Transcend Lighting Series will be available globally in September 2009 and enables electrical and lighting contractors to incorporate LED lights into their construction projects. Molex will showcase its first two products at the 2009 NECA
