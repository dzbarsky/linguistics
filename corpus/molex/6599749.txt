Leviton and Molex Partner to Offer New Integrated, Modular LED Solutions.
Leviton Manufacturing Co., Inc. and Molex Inc. have entered into a strategic alliance to deliver LED lighting solutions to manufacturers of commercial, industrial and residential lighting fixtures. The partnership will align Molex's Transcend(TM) Lighting Series of LED products with Leviton's extensive distribution and sales networks, helping to drive the adoption of LED light source technology to fixture manufacturers on a global scale. This new product offering enables fixture manufacturers to concentrate on their designs by allowing the seamless integration of new, high-efficacy, solid state LED technology to convert existing light fixtures in the market or to design in the new fixture production process. These products offered exclusively through Leviton are compact, interchangeable modules that address issues such as precise heat and current management as well as superior illumination. The products are dimmable using Leviton dimmers and can connect to fixtures using Leviton GU24 base sockets.
