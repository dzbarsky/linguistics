Molex Inc. to Lose 283 Jobs.
The restructuring plan for the site of Molex Inc. in Villemur-sur-Tarn, southern France, has been blocked by the regional court of Toulouse. The plan, which envisages the closure of the facility and the laying off of the workers, was suspended because the works council was not properly informed and consulted on the management's decisions. Molex's trade unions had appealed to the court against the plan, which affects 283 jobs.
