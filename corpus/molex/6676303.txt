Molex Inc. Introduces New Series of SlimStack.
Molex Inc. introduced a new series of SlimStack(TM) board-to-board connectors with a 0.40mm (0.016') pitch that offer an ultra-narrow width of 2.60mm (0.102'). These miniature surface-mount connectors are ideal for tight-packaging applications such as mobile phones, digital cameras or portable audio units. The connectors have a profile height of 1.00mm (0.039'), but can provide greater space savings than many 0.90mm (0.035') height versions. The new series is available in 20 to 80 circuits. The series features gold-plated grounding and soldering tabs that save space while providing secure PCB retention and electrical grounding. The solder tab utilizes a friction lock design which, when combined with a tuning fork terminal design, provides a tactile click feeling for secure contact reliability and protection against drop impact. The tuning fork terminal design provides a long wipe length for superior electrical contact reliability. The SlimStack housing allows for PCB tracing patterns to be run underneath the
