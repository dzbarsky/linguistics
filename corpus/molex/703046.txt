Molex to Build Plant in SW China.
Molex Inc. announced that it is about to build its fourth plant in China, somewhere between the southwestern cities of Chongqing and Chengdu. Molex expects the US $70-million plant will generate some US$200 million of business revenue each year, mostly from selling electronic connectors, a key component for communications, household appliances and automobiles. Chongqing or Chengdu is most likely to become the location of the new plant. Both cities contain some of the world's largest automobile and electronic makers, potential consumers of Molex's products.
