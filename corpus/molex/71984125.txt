Molex Whitepaper Details Process for Designing and Validating New Solder Attach Technology.
Molex Inc. has released a white paper for design engineers, process engineers, product technicians and processing operators interested in applying Solder Charge(TM) technology a new Surface Mount Technology (SMT) concept. The whitepaper will be presented by Molex Product Manager Adam Stanczak and Molex Senior Design Engineer Kirk Peloza at the SMTA International Electronics Exhibition on October 6th in San Diego. SMT innovation is critical as printed circuit board (PCB) assemblies become increasingly dense with components causing real estate to be at a premium. Molex's Solder Charge SMT technology provides better compliancy, less solder-joint stress, higher yields, improved fatigue strength and bonds that are three times stronger than traditional ball-grid array (BGA) technology. The goal of the whitepaper is to lay out the many considerations of developing a new solder attach process.
