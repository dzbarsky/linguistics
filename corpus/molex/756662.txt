Molex Requests Nasdaq Hearing.
Molex Incorporated announced that it has requested a hearing with the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. Molex received a letter from the Nasdaq staff indicating that it is not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), which requires Molex to file with the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. copies of all reports filed or required to be filed with the SEC, and the Company's securities are, therefore, subject to delisting from The Nasdaq National Market. The Molex hearing request delivered to Nasdaq stays the delisting of the Company's securities pending the Panel's decision.
