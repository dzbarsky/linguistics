Molex Inc. Announces General Availability of its OEM-Proven MX123.
Molex Inc. announced the general availability of its innovative, OEM-proven MX123, a fully sealed, high-performance interconnect system optimized for transportation power-train applications. The MX123(TM) system maintains low and stable contact resistance under severe temperatures and vibrations and is ideal for on-engine automotive applications, off-road construction and industrial equipment. The MX123 system uses interfacial and matte-seal technologies to optimize sealing performance and reduce package size and harness-assembly complexity. It features a matte seal technology that allows closer-to-center terminal spacing and eliminates the need for crimping individual cable seals. The interfacial seal is interior to the connector shroud, protecting it from damage during harness handling. Plus, the header pins are protected from scooping by a center wall that extends longer than the terminal length. The MX123 lever receptacles mate with the MX123 vertical headers, and are designed to provide flexibility by of
