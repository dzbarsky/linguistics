Molex Inc. Introduces the iPass+(TM) High Density (HD) System.
Molex Inc. introduces the iPass+(TM) High Density (HD) system, referenced as mini-SAS HD in the SAS 2.1 standard, to meet SAS next-generation speed and density requirements. This innovative system provides 8x as well as 4x cable-plugging options offering customers faster data, more bandwidth and more design flexibility. Molex's iPass+HD technology will drive next-generation SAS solutions by providing increased bandwidth and port density. The iPass+HD external input/output (I/O) connector includes eight sideband signals per 4x port. These additional signals enable active copper and optical cables, as well as active pluggable modules for extended-length applications in data centers. The new pinouts for iPass+HD map easily to existing legacy products. The reduced size of the iPass+HD system provides additional real estate and beach front for system designers. A standard PCIe card can accept four current 4x mini-SAS connectors and a low-profile PCIe card accepts two 4x mini-SAS connectors. The new iPass+HD will p
