Molex Inc. Announces Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable Plus Solution for High-Density Applications.
Molex Inc. introduced the Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable Plus (QSFP+) interconnect solution designed for a multitude of markets and applications including switches, routers, Host Bus Adapters (HBAs), enterprise data centers, high-performance computing (HPC) and storage. Components of the system include the Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) shielding cage, passive cable assembly, active cable assembly, optical MTP cable assembly, optical loopback and a 38-circuit SMT iPass(TM) host connector. QSFP+uses a standard 38-circuit iPass(TM) SMT host connector with a proven mating interface that enables high durability. The iPass contact design, also implemented in other standards such as PCIe, SAS, SATA, Ethernet and InfiniBand, provides four balanced differential channels featuring class-leading isolation, and bandwidth, with durability cycling up to 250 cycles. The Molex host connector mounts to the PCB beneath a low-profile metal cage that provides latch points and is engineered to provide appropriate EMI prote
