Molex Inc. Announces iPass+(TM) HSC CXP Copper and Optical System for Fast and Flexible System Hardware.
Molex Inc. announced the iPass+(TM) High-Speed Channel (HSC) pluggable CXP copper and optical interconnect system enabling twelve channels of 10 Gbps data, for up to 120 Gbps of total bandwidth. The iPass+(TM) CXP provides both copper and optical direct attach options for the same system port, thereby increasing the flexibility of system-level hardware for end users. This innovative dual paddle-card system was adopted as the InfiniBand Architecture Specification Vol. 2 Release 1.2.1; Annex A6 in September 2009. Molex CXP 12X direct attach copper cables are designed to accommodate single, ganged or stacked connector configurations in extremely high-density requirements. CXP passive copper cables are available in a variety of lengths. Further, Molex is developing optical CXP solutions with AOC (active optical cables) pluggable optical module cable assemblies and loopbacks. Cabling options for CXP optical products include 24-fiber round OFNP rated jackets in 3.8 and 5.4mm diameters filling both shorter rack-to-r
