Molex Eyeing Small Acquisitions.
Dave Johnson, the CFO of Molex Inc., said in a conference call, The focus in terms of markets is, number one, looking at some niche technologies that fit in with our existing product lines. But probably the more aggressive -- I mean, we have been more aggressive recently in looking at ways to expand our integrated products business. By looking at cable companies and other companies that will allow us to have more bill of material, more profitability within that part of our business. We look at -- I mean, certainly we look at earnings multiples. When we -- EBITDA multiples primarily, when we look at an acquisition, they have come down since the peak. They haven't come down quite as far as we thought they might come down during the cycle. But it is more important for us to find a company that really fits well with either the technology that we are trying to pursue or with adding more profitability to our existing business. So, we have said that over time one-third of our growth should come from acquisitions. C
