Molex Expands its EdgeLine Family of Products with New CoEdge Connector.
Molex Inc. announced a new addition to the EdgeLine(TM) family of connectors. The EdgeLine CoEdge Connector, which was recently nominated as a DesignVision finalist at the upcoming DesignCon 2010 show, is a one-piece, 25 Gbps connector that is configured to meet an industry standard pitch of 0.80mm (.031"). This low-profile, dual-sided, edgecard connector supports sixteen PCB thickness variations with multiple circuit sizes for high-speed, industry-standard, edgecard applications. CoEdge connectors ensure PCBs are aligned at the centerline to allow for a uniform signal path across the length of the connector. Keying and locking features are provided to secure the connector to the PCB and improve board alignment during mating. Application tooling is not needed allowing for easy board installation.
