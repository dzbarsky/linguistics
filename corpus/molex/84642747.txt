Molex Inc. Releases Two Additions to the Impact(TM) Backplane Connector System.
Molex Inc. has released two additions to the Impact(TM) Backplane Connector System, its high-speed, high-density connector system for the telecommunication and data networking market. The Impact CoPlanar Connector System and Impact Mezzanine Connector System provide the ultimate flexibility to optimize designs for superior mechanical and electrical performance. Both products will be demonstrated by Molex in booth 509 at DesignCon, February 2-3, Santa Clara, CA. The Impact Backplane Connector System is available in 2- to 6-pair configurations with a complete range of guidance and power solution options. It provides data rates up to 25 Gbps and superior signal density up to 80 differential pairs per inch. The Impact system's broad-edge-coupled transmission technology enables low cross talk and high signal bandwidth while minimizing channel-performance variation across every differential pair within the system. Impact CoPlanar Connector System: Available in multiple compliant-pin design options on both right ang
