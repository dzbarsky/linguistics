Molex Inc. Unveils Several Products.
Molex Inc. announced that the company recently unveiled several products that meet the high-speed, high-density, high-signal-integrity needs for virtually any application, including: Impact(TM) Backplane Connector System: The Impact Backplane Connector System's broad-edge-coupled transmission technology enables low cross talk and high signal bandwidth while minimizing channel-performance variation across every differential pair within the system. It provides data rates of over 25 Gbps, superior signal density and flexible configurations including the recently introduced CoPlanar Connector System and Mezzanine Connector System. EdgeLine(TM) CoEdge(TM) Connector (DesignVision Finalist): The Edgeline CoEdge Connector is a one-piece, 25 Gbps edgecard--to-edgecard connector that is configured to meet an industry standard pitch of 0.80mm (.031"). This low-profile, dual-sided, edgecard connector supports sixteen PCB thickness variations with multiple circuit sizes for high-speed, scalable solutions in low-to-mid ran
