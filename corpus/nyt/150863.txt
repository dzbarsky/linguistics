Times Co. Says 2003 Earnings Will Not Meet Analysts' Estimates.
"The New York Times Company said that its earnings for the second quarter and all of 2003 would fall short of analysts' estimates because of weak advertising demand and higher-than-expected costs. The company said its profit in the current quarter would be 43 to 47 cents a share. That compares with Wall Street expectations of 54 cents a share, according to I.B.E.S., which compiles analysts' forecasts. The company predicts that the percentage increase in earnings this year would be in the low- to mid-single digits compared with the 2002 results. Previously, the company said it expected earnings to rise in the mid-single to low-double digits."
