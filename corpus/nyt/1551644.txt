The New York Times Names Byron E. Calame as Public Editor.
The New York Times Co. announced that Byron E. (Barney) Calame, a former deputy managing editor at The Wall Street Journal, will become its next public editor on May 9, succeeding Daniel Okrent. Mr. Calame, 65, retired in 2004 as a deputy managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, where his responsibilities included paper-wide quality control, maintenance and monitoring of reporting and ethical standards, and oversight of the Journal in the absence of the managing editor. He joined the Journal in 1965 and worked as a reporter in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., before becoming a bureau chief in Pittsburgh in 1974. The public editor works outside of the reporting and editing structure of The Times and receives and answers questions or comments from readers and the public, principally about articles published in the newspaper.
