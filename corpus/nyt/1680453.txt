New York Times Unveils Classified Ad-based Weekly.
The New York Times Co. will begin distributing MarketPlace Weekly, a free, tabloid-sized listing of classified ads supplemented by reprinted Times articles, this week. The guide will join a crop of free papers that have sprung up in recent years, but will be distributed during the evening commute, rather than in the morning. It will feature articles from the Job Market, Real Estate, Automotive, Business, and Dining Out sections.
