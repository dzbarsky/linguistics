NY Times enters Discovery TV venture.
The Times York Times Co. and Discovery Communications Inc. entered into a joint venture agreement to co-own and program the history-focused cable network. Though the Times' $100 million investment gives it a 50% economic stake in the channel, it will not control the venture. DCI will retain a 50% stake, and control and manage the network through a board of directors split 3-2 in DCI's favor. There will, however, be an appointed editorial board with equal representation.
