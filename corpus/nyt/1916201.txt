The New York Times Introduces Innovative Ad Unit in Stock Listings.
The New York Times is introducing advertising-supported branded watermarks that will be superimposed over a Tuesday to Saturday page of its public company stock listings in the Business Day section of the newspaper. This new advertising offering will appear on a periodic basis and has been designed for major branding campaigns and new product launches, where reaching the financial community is of particular importance. The branded watermark will occupy a full page of tabular stock listings and will include the advertiser's message on the bottom of the page.
