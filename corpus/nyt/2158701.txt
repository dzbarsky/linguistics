Closed Merger/Acquisition Transaction - Target: Boston Metro Publishing, Inc.; Buyer(s): New York Times Co.; Seller(s): Metro USA Inc.; Transaction Size: $16.5 mm.
"The New York Times Company has entered into an agreement whereby it will acquired a 49% interest in Metro Boston, the free daily newspaper of the Metro USA division of Metro International, for $16.5 million. Metro USA will own the other 51% and continue to control and manage Metro Boston, which will be governed by a Board of Directors made up of Metro USA and New York Times Company executives. The transaction is expected to close in January 2005. Metro's editorial format will not change as a result of this transaction, and the Boston Globe newsroom will not be involved in the editing of the paper. In 2004 Metro Boston generated approximately $10 million in revenue. The New York Times Company completed the purchase of a 49% interest in Metro Boston on 03/11/2005. Completion of the transaction came after The United States Department of Justice said that it had officially closed its inquiry into whether the joint venture between the two newspapers raised anti-trust concerns."
