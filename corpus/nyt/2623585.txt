New York Times Co. Announces Management Changes.
New York Times Co. reported that the top television executive at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced on February 9, 2006 that he would be stepping down. The executive, Michael Pack, controlled a $70 million production budget and was described by the official who hired him as a conservative Republican. He chose to resign after Patricia S. Harrison, the corporation's new president, forced him to decide between renewing his employment contract and exercising a soon-to-expire option that gives him $500,000 to produce a documentary.
