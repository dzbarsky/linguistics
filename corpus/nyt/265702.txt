Cytodyne Technologies Inc. Files Federal Lawsuit Against The New York Times.
The New York Times and one of its key investigative reporters are named in a federal lawsuit filed in New Jersey. The Times is accused of engaging in a pattern and practice of failing to supervise its reporters and failing to check the accuracy and completeness of the stories that run in the newspaper. Court filing comes in the wake of the scandal that rocked the newspaper in May 2003, in which former reporter Jayson Blair admitted he filed hundreds of fabricated stories and those he copied from other newspapers. The controversy led to the resignation of several top editors.
