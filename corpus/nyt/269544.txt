CNN Reaches Deal With N.Y. Times, Globe.
CNN has reached an agreement with The New York Times and The Boston Globe to make the newspapers' reporters available for stories. The reporters will deliver their reports on-screen with the newspapers' logos visible. The deal was attractive to the newspapers because it gives an additional audience for its reporting, said Toby Usnik, spokesman for the New York Times Co. which also owns the Globe.
