New York Times Co. announced the Ellis Island Legacy Keepsake, a new product for Americans who are interested in commemorating their families' immigration to this country. Visitors to www.NYTstore.com/ellis can purchase a framed tribute to their family's heritage, which includes details about their family's arrival in America. Through a collaboration with The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, visitors to www.NYTstore.com/ellis will be granted free access to the records of more than 22 million immigrants and passengers who arrived at Ellis Island and the Port of New York between 1892 and 1924; they can then search for an ancestor's name and see a copy of the actual passenger list from the ship on which they sailed.
