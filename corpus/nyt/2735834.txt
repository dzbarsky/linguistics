Supreme Court Refuses to Block Defamation Lawsuit Against the New York Times Co.
The Supreme Court refused to block a defamation lawsuit against the New York Times Co. over columns that linked a former Army scientist to the 2001 anthrax killings. Authorities have never found out who mailed anthrax-laced letters that killed five people and sickened 17 others not long after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Steven J. Hatfill, a physician and bioterrorism expert, was labeled a person of interest by then-Attorney General John D. Ashcroft but was never charged. He has since sued Ashcroft and others. A federal judge had thrown out Hatfill's lawsuit against the New York Times over 2002 columns by writer Nicholas Kristof that faulted the FBI for not thoroughly investigating Hatfill. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reinstated the lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined without comment to hear the case.
