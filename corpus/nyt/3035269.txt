New York Times Co. Plans to Cut 250 Jobs and Shrink the Size of its Pages in 2008.
New York Times Co. plans to cut 250 jobs and shrink the size of its pages in 2008, making them one-and-a-half inches narrower. The newspaper's plans include closing a printing plant in Edison, N.J. The plant's workload will shift to another in New York City, estimating the moves would save the company $42 million per year. The job cuts account for about one-third of the Times' total production work force of 800. The reduction in the size of its pages would mean a loss of 11% of the space devoted to news, but the newspaper plans to add pages to make up for about half of that loss.
