New York Times Says no Plans to Sell New England Properties.
New York Times Co. has no plans to sell any of its New England properties, despite persistent and steep advertising and circulation declines at the unit that includes the Boston Globe newspaper. Chief Executive Janet Robinson told analysts on a conference call that the company has no such plans. Asked if certain recent newspaper sales had given New York Times Co. any ideas about its New England assets, Robinson said the unit, which also includes Boston.com and the Worcester Telegram & Gazette, is still "a very strong element" in the company's portfolio. Many advertisers in the region, she added, consider the Globe and the other publications "must buys" when trying to reach local consumers.
