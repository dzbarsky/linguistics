New York Times Will Sell TV Stations.
The New York Times Co. said on September 12 that it intends to sell its group of nine network affiliated TV stations in order to concentrate on its newspaper and digital businesses. Chief Executive Janet L. Robinson said in a statement that while the stations were profitable and well run, the sales would 'allow us to sharpen our focus on developing our newspaper and rapidly growing digital businesses, and the synergies between them.' The stations being sold by the Times include WHO-TV, KFSM-TV, WHNT-TV, WREG-TV, WQAD-TV, WTKR-TV, KFOR-TV, KAUT-TV and WNEP-TV.
