New York Times Company Announces Plan To Sell Its Broadcast Media Group.
The New York Times Company announced on September 13 that it plans to sell its Broadcast Media Group, which includes nine network-affiliated television stations and their related properties. "The decision to explore the sale of our broadcast stations is a result of our ongoing analysis of our business portfolio," said Janet L. Robinson, president and CEO. "These are well-managed and profitable stations that generate substantial cash flows and are located in attractive markets. We believe a divestiture would allow us to sharpen our focus on developing our newspaper and rapidly growing digital businesses, and the synergies between them, thereby increasing the value of our Company for our shareholders." The stations that comprise the Broadcast Media Group are: WHO-TV in Des Moines, Iowa; KFSM-TV in Ft. Smith, Ark.; WHNT-TV in Huntsville, Ala.; WREG-TV in Memphis, Tenn.; WQAD-TV in Moline, Ill.; WTKR-TV in Norfolk, Va.; KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City, Okla.; KAUT-TV in Oklahoma City, Okla.; and WNEP-TV in Scranton, Pen
