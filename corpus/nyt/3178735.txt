New York Times and The Paradies Shops to Open The New York Times Bookstore in the Delta Terminal at La Guardia Airport.
The New York Times and The Paradies Shops announced the opening of The New York Times Bookstore at the Delta Air Lines Terminal in La Guardia Airport. This is the second joint bookstore venture for The Times and Paradies. The companies announced their exclusive licensing agreement in early 2005 when The Times granted Paradies a license to develop and operate Times-branded bookstores in airports, including the right to sell Times merchandise.
