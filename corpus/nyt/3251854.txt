Federal Judge Orders New York Times Co. to Disclose the Confidential Sources Used by Nicholas Kristof.
A federal judge has ordered New York Times Co. to disclose the confidential sources used by Nicholas Kristof in columns that explored whether a former Army scientist was responsible for the deadly 2001 anthrax attacks. The ruling, which the Times said it would appeal, came in a lawsuit filed by the former scientist, Steven Hatfill, contending the paper defamed him in a series of Kristof columns in 2002 that identified him as a likely culprit. Hatfill has been identified by authorities as a person of interest in the anthrax-spore mailings that killed five people and sickened 17. No one has been charged in the attacks.
