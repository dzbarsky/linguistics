Jane Pauley Sues New York Times Co. Over Ad Supplement.
New York Times Co. announced that television news anchor Jane Pauley has sued the company, saying she was misled to believe she was being interviewed for an article on mental health when she actually was being featured in an advertising supplement. In a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Ms. Pauley sought unspecified damages and a stop to the use of her name and image for advertising purposes. The lawsuit says Ms. Pauley has taken care to protect her reputation and avoid self-promotion by refusing to be a paid spokeswoman or to endorse commercial products, except for work aiding charitable organizations or noncommercial ventures.
