Maurice Greenberg Buying New York Times Shares.
Maurice Greenberg, the former head of American International Group Inc., has been buying shares of New York Times Co. to try to break the Sulzberger family's hold on the media company, the New York Post reported on November 29th, citing unnamed sources. Greenberg has been buying hundreds of thousands of Times shares, the Post reported, putting him in league with other shareholders, such as Morgan Stanley Investment Management, who have been questioning the Sulzbergers' holding of a more powerful class of stock. "I can't comment about Mr. Greenberg's stock purchases," said Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the former insurance executive. Corallo reiterated that Greenberg "is exploring several options involving media companies." The New York Times was not immediately available for comment.
