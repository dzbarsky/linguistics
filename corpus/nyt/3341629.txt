The New York Times Announces Times Reader in Free Beta.
New York Times Co. announced the release of Times Reader, available in a free beta on NYTimes.com. Times Reader is a downloadable application that enhances the onscreen reading experience of The New York Times for Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista users. It offers consumers access to The Times electronically, online or offline from a desktop, laptop, tablet PC or ultra-mobile computing device. Times Reader lets users retrieve the latest news and photos, through a synching process that lasts approximately one minute. Times Reader combines the interactivity and immediacy of the Web with the portability of a newspaper through Windows Presentation Foundation, Microsoft's advanced display technology in Windows Vista. The text in Times Reader is displayed in a format to fit the size and layout of any computer screen and enables readers to customize the display according to personal preferences, such as font size and content relevance.
