Atheros Communications Announces Industry's First Open Source Simple Configuration Software.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced that the company will offer its JumpStart for Wireless security configuration software on an open-source basis for free use by anyone in the WLAN industry. The availability of the JumpStart Developer's Kit marks the first time that all the elements needed by customers to create and offer a user-friendly WLAN security setup system have been provided in open source form. JumpStart leverages the protocol underlying secure e-commerce transactions (the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol) along with other proven industry-standard protocols. While these protocols make it possible to achieve enterprise-class WLAN security, designing a secure system that is also easy to use has proven challenging for vendors. JumpStart eliminates this challenge by providing a pre-packaged solution that is readily available in open source form.
