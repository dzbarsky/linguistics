Atheros Communications Introduces the ROCm(TM) Platform for High-Performance, Low-Power Mobile WLAN Applications.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced its first Radio-on-Chip for Mobile (ROCm(TM)) products. These single-chip wireless LAN (WLAN) solutions deliver the robust, high-throughput performance of Atheros data- and video-networking products plus the characteristics required for mobile devices: low power consumption, small form factor, and low-overhead operation for the host device. These characteristics make the Atheros ROCm platform ideal for consumer products such as dual-mode cellular phones, VoIP handsets, MP3 portable media players, digital still/video cameras, and gaming consoles. The ROCm family includes single- and dual-band chips, the AR6001G and AR6001X, respectively. Both chips provide 54-Mbps connectivity to a market traditionally served by lower-rate solutions that consume far more power.
