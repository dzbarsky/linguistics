Atheros AR5002AP-2X Selected for Aruba 80 Outdoor AP.
Atheros Communications Inc. has announced that its dual-band 802.11a/b/g chipset, AR5002AP-2X, is featured in Aruba's new multi-purpose, dual-band outdoor access point (AP). The Aruba 80 enables enterprises to operate 802.11a and 802.11b/g wireless networks concurrently. The Aruba 80 is a fully-hardened dual-radio 802.11a+b/g AP that's ideally suited for extending enterprise wireless networks to transportation loading bays, manufacturing sites, campuses, and office parks. It can also be used to wirelessly connect buildings instead of running expensive leased lines between office buildings.
