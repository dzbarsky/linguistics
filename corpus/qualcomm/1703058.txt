Atheros Communications Inc. announced that livedoor Co. Ltd., a popular Internet service provider and web portal in Japan, is launching a new public WLAN service, called D-cubic, that uses Atheros' WLAN solution with Atheros XR(TM) and Super G(R) performance-enhancement features. Livedoor plans to start a trial service in July on a section of the JR Yamanote Line, a circular train line that connects all of Tokyo's major city centers. The service will be expanded to cover the entire Yamanote line in October.
