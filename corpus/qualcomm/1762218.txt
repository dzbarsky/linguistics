Lenovo Launches New 802.11g Router Using Atheros WLAN Technology.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced that Lenovo Networks, a subsidiary of Lenovo Group Limited has launched a high performance 802.11g router, the LSA 800R, based on Atheros' WLAN technology. Lenovo's Commercial Desktop PC Business Unit is bundling the router with its latest Yang Tian Series of desktop PCs. The Lenovo LSA-800R WLAN router features Atheros' AR5006AP-G chip, the world's first single-chip product designed specifically for wireless access points and routers, which was introduced in December 2004. The Atheros AR5006AP-G is a highly integrated WLAN solution, combining the wireless network processor, media access controller (MAC), baseband and radio functions into a single silicon chip. The innovative single-chip solution lowers the cost of integrating wireless LAN technology, without compromising performance, in wireless access points, routers and other networking devices.
