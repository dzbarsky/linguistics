Atheros Communications Expands Performance and Possibilities With First Draft 802.11n Wireless LAN Solutions.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the launch of its XSPAN(TM) family of wireless LAN (WLAN) technologies and availability of the AR5008, the first series of chipsets to deliver XSPAN benefits. The AR5008 solutions, demonstrated earlier this month at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), are the first to be based on the draft 802.11n specification confirmed last week by the IEEE. These next-generation WLAN solutions will exploit the full potential of MIMO technology by delivering breakthrough performance and industry interoperability. The AR5008 solutions deliver six times the throughput of 802.11g and 802.11a/g products at extended range and with greater reliability. With the 802.11n draft specification now in place, consumers will at last enjoy the benefits of interoperable MIMO technology across a broad range of devices and applications in the home and office as well as on the go. The Atheros AR5008 series of two-chip solutions is based on the world's only triple-radio chip paired with a baseband an
