Atheros XSPAN Draft 802.11n Mini Card Reference Designs Achieve Industry's First PCI Express Compatibility Certification.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced that both its mini card reference design for laptops based on Atheros' high performance XSPAN(TM) draft 802.11n technology and the Atheros AR5008 draft 802.11n chipset have received PCI Express(TM) (PCIe)(1) compatibility certification. The Atheros XB72 draft 802.11n mini card reference design is the first in the industry to achieve PCIe compatibility certification. With this qualification, PC manufacturers can minimize product development time and risk of non-compatibility with the PCIe standard while integrating the reference design into new wireless-enabled laptops. The Atheros AR5008 draft 802.11n chipset, which also received PCIe compatibility certification, is the first member of the company's popular XSPAN family to offer a superior wireless user experience by delivering physical data rates up to 300 megabits-per-second (Mbps).
