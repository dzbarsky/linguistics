Atheros Communications Inc. Launches XSPAN Value Solution.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the launch of its AR5008V XSPAN(TM) chipset, a high-performance, cost-optimized draft 802.11n solution featuring a 2x2 MIMO design. The AR5008V chipset is supported by Atheros' first family of network processors, the AR7100. This pairing reduces the manufacturing costs of draft 802.11n wireless routers and access points (APs), enabling broad adoption of the new, high-performance WLAN technology. Unlike general-purpose central processing units, Atheros' AR7100 family is optimized for wireless LAN (WLAN) AP/router performance, features and cost. The first two members of the high-performance, scalable AR7100 family are AR7100B -- 300MHz with dual 10/100 Ethernet ports and AR7100P -- 400MHz with dual 10/100/1000 (Gigabit) Ethernet ports.
