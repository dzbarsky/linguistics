Atheros Launches World's Most-Integrated, Single-Chip 802.11g Solution for PCI Express.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the Atheros AR5007EG -- the industry's most highly-integrated, cost-effective 802.11g PCI Express(TM) (PCIe) solution. It is the world's only design to incorporate the complete wireless LAN (WLAN) solution, including the low noise amplifier (LNA) and power amplifier (PA), in a low-cost, single-chip digital CMOS design. This extraordinary integration significantly reduces the cost of implementing Wi-Fi technology in desktop and value-priced notebook PCs -- removing previous cost barriers to enabling wireless in these more price-sensitive PC market sectors.
