MontaVista and Atheros Deliver High Performance SDIO Stack to Open Source Community.
MontaVista Software Inc. announced the creation of a new open source project to provide full SDIO functionality to Linux. Using an extensive code base developed by Atheros, the collaborative effort will provide an open source and architecture independent solution that offers high performance throughput while maintaining the flexibility to support various SDIO host controllers and devices. MontaVista will apply its broad open source expertise and hardware experience to the Atheros SDIO code in order to support the latest community standards. The Linux community participation should result in a more robust and complete solution with rapid problem resolution and better overall design. As part of the initial deliverable, MontaVista will be integrating wireless LAN (WLAN) and SD/MMC card support. The project will allow for a SDIO stack that can be merged into the mainstream Linux-MMC code as soon as the SDIO API framework is available. Until then, MontaVista will make the SDIO stack available to the community by o
