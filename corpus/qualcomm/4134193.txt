Atheros Expands Networking Portfolio with Gigabit Ethernet PHY.
Atheros Communications Inc. launched the cost competitive, single-port Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) PHY, the AR8021. Atheros is bringing the company's unmatched analog and mixed signal design expertise to its second- generation GbE PHY to achieve significant technical advantages. The AR8021 is the world's smallest GbE PHY device - offering a reduction of more than 60% in package size compared to the nearest competitive solution. This GbE PHY footprint results in the lowest bill-of-materials (BOM) cost on the market, reducing price barriers to widespread adoption of GbE PHY technology in a wide range of computing and networking applications. This latest addition to Atheros' growing Ethernet portfolio, the AR8021 GbE PHY, serves a growing number of devices that benefit from Gigabit throughput including notebook and desktop PCs, wired and wireless routers, gateways, set-top boxes, printers, gaming platforms and network storage devices.
