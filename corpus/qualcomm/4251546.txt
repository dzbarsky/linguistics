Atheros Communications Inc. Launches XSPAN(TM) draft 2.0 802.11n.
Atheros Communications Inc. launched its second generation XSPAN(TM) draft 2.0 802.11n product line. The new AR9001 family of chipset solutions builds upon the company's first generation XSPAN products - with enhanced performance, higher integration, smaller form factors and lower overall cost - to meet the needs of the growing 802.11n market. Like Atheros' previous generation XSPAN products, the AR9001 family is compliant to the latest IEEE draft 2.0 802.11n specification. Last week Atheros' XSPAN technology achieved industry validation through its selection into the Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA) Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 802.11n draft 2.0 testing program. Atheros will demonstrate its new XSPAN designs at COMPUTEX in Taipei, Taiwan, June 5-9, 2007, in its Technology Suite (#2448) at the Grand Hyatt Taipei.
