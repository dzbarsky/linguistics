Ikanos Communications and Atheros Communications Inc. Debuts VDSL2 Gateway Reference Platform Featuring Atheros 802.11n XSPAN Technology.
Ikanos Communications and Atheros Communications Inc. have jointly developed a Fusiv(R)-based reference platform that integrates VDSL2 technology with the new 802.11n draft 2.0 technology. This reference platform combines Ikanos' Fusiv Vx180, introduced as the industry's fastest integrated VDSL2 gateway processor, with Atheros' XSPAN(TM) 802.11n draft 2.0 solutions, the Wi-Fi market's most broadly adopted new-generation designs, to provide a high-performance, wireless-enabled, xDSL residential gateway reference platform for triple play applications. The reference platform is a fully qualified solution that offers scalability and best-in-class performance. The Vx180 supports 802.11n wireless LAN (WLAN) using less than one-half the processing power of comparable DSL platforms. This is accomplished by optimizing and running 802.11n drivers on Fusiv's distributed architecture, which includes a host CPU and multiple high-performance Accelerator Processors.
