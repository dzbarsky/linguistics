Atheros Introduces First Adaptive Bandwidth WLAN Technology.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the first commercial deployment of adaptive bandwidth technology. This new capability, which is based on Atheros' award-winning Super G(TM) technology, is a software update that provides performance-on-demand based on channel availability. It is the first commercial deployment of a variable-bandwidth radio system that will monitor the entire 802.11g band and automatically increase the throughput when channels are available. Atheros Super G technology operates in two modes to increase bandwidth. The base mode uses standards-based data compression, large frames and bursting features to deliver real-world network throughput in excess of 40 Mbps for typical data files, an increase of up to two times over traditional 802.11g networks. The enhanced mode, called Dynamic Turbo, further increases throughput by extending the bandwidth of the signal to provide a total throughput of over 60 Mbps for typical data, up to three times greater than traditional 802.11g networks.
