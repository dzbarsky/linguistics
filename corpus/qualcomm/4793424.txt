ArrayComm Files Patent Infringement Lawsuit Against Atheros Communications.
ArrayComm announced that it has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Atheros Communications Inc. in the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division. The patents involved in the suit include U.S. Patent Nos.5,592,490, 5,642,353 and 5,828,658. In its complaint, ArrayComm alleges that Atheros' XSPAN chips infringe a number of ArrayComm patents that cover many aspects of multi-antenna signal processing. Further, the complaint alleges that wireless routing products that comply with the IEEE802.11n draft specification, and which incorporate Atheros XSPAN chips, also infringe the same ArrayComm patents. The Complaint seeks both money damages and injunctive relief. The lawsuit was filed after a two year effort by ArrayComm to amicably resolve its concerns over Atheros' infringement of ArrayComm's patents.
