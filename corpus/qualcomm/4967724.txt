Atheros Expands ROCm Bluetooth Portfolio with New System-on-chip for Headsets.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the second member of its growing ROCm(TM) family of Bluetooth wireless solutions -- the Atheros AR3031. This system-on-chip (SoC) meets the growing demand for Bluetooth wireless mono headsets by providing a powerful combination of market-leading power-efficiency, design flexibility and cost. The solution employs Atheros' leading RF CMOS and systems engineering expertise to deliver the industry's lowest bill-of-materials (BOM) cost using an economical, single-chip, 5mm x 5mm QFN package, while most competitive solutions use more expensive BGA packages. The AR3031 also features an integrated, high-density Read-Only Memory, which provides greater cost-efficiencies over higher-priced, competitive Flash-based solutions.
