Atheros Communications Inc. Unveils Two Single-Chip 802.11n Solutions Developed Expressly for the Carrier Gateway Market.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced two single-chip 802.11n solutions developed expressly for the carrier gateway market. The new dual-band, 2.4GHz/5GHz, AR9220 and single-band, 2.4GHz AR9223 PCI designs join the comprehensive Atheros XSPAN(TM) family, the world's most widely adopted draft 802.11n Wi-Fi solutions. These latest 802.11n designs provide reliable, market-proven performance at price points that allow carriers to broadly deploy home gateways capable of supporting data, voice and video on a single wireless network. They are the second implementation of Atheros' new single-chip 11n design which follows last month's introduction of the company's half-mini card for PCI Express (PCIe), the world's most integrated, compact 802.11n solution for PCs.
