Atheros to Demonstrate Its Entire ROCm Portfolio and Feature Its AR6001 Mobile WLAN Implementation on the NVIDIA APX 2500 Development Platform.
Atheros will demonstrate its entire ROCm portfolio and feature its AR6001 mobile WLAN implementation on the NVIDIA APX 2500 development platform, a breakthrough applications processor designed to enable advanced multimedia features in a new breed of smartphones, at Mobile World Congress 2008. Next-generation smartphones are rapidly evolving into personal multimedia computers that require extraordinary WLAN performance and power efficiencies. To support this new era of mobile computing performance, Atheros' ROCm solutions deliver infrastructure-class throughput while using 70% less power in active mode than competing Wi-Fi products, and near-zero (0.06mW) power in standby mode.
