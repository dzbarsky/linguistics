Atheros Communications and Mobilecast Telematics Cooperate to Develop Telematics Systems.
Atheros Communications Inc. and Mobilecast Telematics Inc. have agreed to establish a technology partnership for developing two-way information distribution/communications systems for automotive applications and Broadband Area Network systems for the telematics market. The partnership aims to produce products that combine Mobilecast's embedded vehicular router MAG(TM) and its Broadband ITS router with WLAN AP, which uses Atheros' Super AG(TM) technology. To further increase the penetration of Atheros-based products into the broadband market, Mobilecast and Atheros have also agreed to develop solutions for 'hot-area' business services, which allow drivers and passengers to access broadband applications continuously while their vehicle is moving at high speeds. The two companies will also work on VoIP technology for the telematics market.
