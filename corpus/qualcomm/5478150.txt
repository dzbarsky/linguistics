Atheros Communications Inc. Enables Industry-Leading Wi-Fi in Next-Generation Cable Modem Gateways Based on Texas Instruments Puma 5 Product Family.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced that its high-performance XSPAN(R) 802.11n single and dual-band options, and its popular 802.11g solutions now support Texas Instruments' (TI) next-generation, wireless-enabled cable modem gateway platform. The new reference designs are the first in a series based on Atheros' Wi-Fi and TI's Puma 5 family of DOCSIS(R) 3.0 cable modem chipsets, which are optimized for triple play and next-generation IP services. The collaboration between Atheros and TI enables Multiple Service Operators (MSOs) or service providers to easily add Wi-Fi connectivity to cable modem gateways, eliminating the need for multiple boxes, and simplifying home and SOHO networks. MSOs can now choose among a wide array of Atheros high-performance Wi-Fi options to generate incremental revenue from subscribers enabled with wireless services.
