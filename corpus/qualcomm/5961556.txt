Atheros Communications Inc. Launches Align(TM) Technology Leveraging 802.11n 1-Stream Specification to Provide Upgrade from Legacy 802.11g.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the first members of its Align(TM) product family, the industry's most complete portfolio of wireless LAN (WLAN) solutions based on the IEEE draft 802.11n 1-stream specification. The single-stream feature enables a new class of Wi-Fi(R) devices that deliver performance enhancements over the existing 802.11g technology, at comparable price points. Align solutions are also forward compatible to higher-performance, multi-stream, MIMO-based 802.11n--providing the optimal upgrade path for value-class WLAN products. Consumers who move from 802.11g to products based on Align 1-stream technology will experience enhanced performance in their home networks. Align solutions deliver up to 150 Mbps PHY rates, and leverage the efficiencies of the 802.11n media access control (MAC) technology to achieve actual throughput levels up to five times that of legacy 802.11g. The higher throughput of 1-stream products improves network efficiency by occupying the wireless channel for shorter per
