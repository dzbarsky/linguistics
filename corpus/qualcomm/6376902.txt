Atheros ROCm GPS Technology Drives Fast Navigation in Mio and Magellan PNDs.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced that several new Mio and Magellan personal navigation devices (PNDs) now leverage Atheros' ROCm GPS technology for unmatched navigational performance, even in the most challenging environments. The Atheros AR1511 high-performance, single-chip GPS receiver and companion ORION 3.1 software suite deliver precise navigation employing the company's Assisted GPS (AGPS) technology, advanced parallel search and superior tracking sensitivity. Atheros' AGPS technology speeds navigation, even in challenging multi-path and obscured-sky environments. In network-connected devices, this performance is achieved by quickly securing ephemeris information through Internet or cellular networks. For unconnected devices, ephemeris information that has been previously gathered from the satellites is stored and manipulated with algorithms to reliably predict satellite positions for up to five days. Consumers benefit from the convenience of quick, accurate mapping and navigation through this inte
