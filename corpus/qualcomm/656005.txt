Atheros Communications' Wireless LAN Products Selected for Inclusion in WPA2(TM) Certification Test Bed.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced its WLAN products have been chosen by the Wi-Fi Alliance for inclusion in the WPA2(TM). WPA2 is the next generation of Wi-Fi security, based on the final 802.11i standard. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) ratified the 802.11i standard in June 2004, and the Wi-Fi Alliance launched its WPA2 interoperability testing. Wireless products that are WPA2 CERTIFIED offer the strongest available security in the form of AES-level encryption (Advanced Encryption Standard). Additionally WPA2 CERTIFIED products offer enhancements that enable 802.1x authentication in either ad-hoc mode or in traditional infrastructure networks, and accelerate re-authentication using key caching and pre-authentication techniques.
