Atheros Delivers First Mobile Infrastructure Mode Functionality to NTT DOCOMO Customers in NEC's New, Dual-Mode Handset.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced that its revolutionary AP Mode technology is now offered by NTT DOCOMO Inc. to its FOMA(TM) customers with the new NEC N-06A dual-mode handset, docomo PRIME series(TM). This new smartphone is the first on the market that uses Atheros AP Mode technology to allow users to connect their Wi-Fi(R)-enabled laptops and devices to the Internet without an access point (AP) present. This groundbreaking Atheros mobile WLAN technology significantly expands the functionality of the handset, enabling a wide array of new applications for mobile users. AP Mode, an optional feature of the Atheros AR6002 Radio-on-Chip for Mobile (ROCm(R)) WLAN solution, allows handsets to operate in infrastructure mode, the primary wireless connectivity framework employed in access points, routers, laptops and other WLAN devices. Infrastructure mode offers significant advantages such as greater ease of use and lower power consumption over ad-hoc mode, a legacy approach to device connectivity.
