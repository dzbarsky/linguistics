Atheros Communications' Wireless LAN Products Receive Wi-Fi Certification for WMM(TM) and Featured in the New WMM Test Bed.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced that two of its WLAN reference designs have been Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia) by the Wi-Fi Alliance. Atheros' Dual-Band Access Point and Universal 802.11a/b/g Wireless Network Adapter reference designs have also been chosen for inclusion in the WMM certification test bed. WMM is the Wi-Fi Alliance's new program that's based on a subset of the 802.11e standard, which provides Quality of Service (QoS) for wireless networks. The Wi-Fi Alliance began Wi-Fi certification for WMM on September 8. Atheros' 802.11a/b/g client and access point reference designs will be used to test 802.11b, 802.11b/g, or 802.11a/b/g products that are submitted for certification of WMM. The Wi-Fi Alliance will indicate which products pass the interoperability tests.
