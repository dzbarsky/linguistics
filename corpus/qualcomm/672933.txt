Atheros Communications and BroVis Wireless Networks Collaborate to Offer High-speed Outdoor Wireless Broadband for the Emerging Indian Subcontinent Market.
Atheros Communications Inc. and BroVis Wireless Networks (formerly Air Manage Networks), announced their technology collaboration on products that deliver very high-speed outdoor broadband wireless connectivity for the Indian Subcontinent market. BroVis' new Broadcell solution suite, comprised of the AS1000 Base Station, AC100 Subscriber Unit and WIOS (Wireless Infrastructure Operating System) software, features wireless chipset technology from Atheros. BroVis' products are the first to deliver broadband in the fast-growing Indian Subcontinent market using an 802.11 concurrent band architecture over wider distances than traditional systems in rough and challenging Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) terrains. The solution represents a unique application of Atheros' core wireless technology, reaching distances of up to 5 kilometers in NLOS applications and Point-to-Multipoint network configurations, and up to 22 kilometers in Line-of-Sight (LOS) applications.
