Netgear Inc. Selects Atheros Communications Inc.'s Atheros' 802.11a/b/g WLAN solution for its Double 108 Mbps Wireless Firewall Router.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced that NETGEAR Inc. has selected Atheros' 802.11a/b/g WLAN solution with eXtended Range (XR) technology for its new high-performance Double 108 Mbps Wireless Firewall Router (WGU624). Atheros' innovative XR technology enables the NETGEAR router to cover multi-story brick or masonry homes and reduces dead spots. While typical 802.11 chipset solutions focus heavily on maximizing throughput in benchmark tests or in office environments, few perform well at long range or in more challenging spaces, such as in a multi-story home. Atheros chipset solutions, however, dramatically stretch the performance of a WLAN by embedding separate optimized designs for high performance, high signal-to-noise and long range, low signal-to-noise ratio environments. The architecture delivers receive sensitivities of up to -105dBm, over 20 dB better than the 802.11 specification. The eXtended Range operation is transparent to end users, and wireless products enabled with XR technology are fully inte
