Atheros Communications Introduces First Single-Chip 802.11a/b/g Wireless LAN Solution.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the first complete single-chip IEEE 802.11a/b/g WLAN solution, the Atheros AR5006X. The chip integrates an entire 802.11a/b/g solution -- Media Access Controller (MAC), baseband processor, and a high-performance radio with both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz capabilities -- in a low-cost digital CMOS design. Offering seamless connectivity to all Wi-Fi networks anywhere in the world, full support for the IEEE 802.11i security standard, and support for Atheros XR(TM) (eXtended Range) and Super AG(TM) performance enhancements, the AR5006X is ideal for PC OEM, enterprise, retail, and consumer electronics devices. The breakthrough single-chip IEEE 802.11a/b/g solution complements Atheros' launch in January 2004 of the industry's first single-chip IEEE 802.11b/g solution. It further solidifies the company's position as a market leader in high-performance, low-cost wireless LAN semiconductors.
