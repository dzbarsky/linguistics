Atheros Communications Inc. Announces 2-Stream 11n Solutions.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced 2-stream 11n solutions, the AR9287 PCIe and the AR9227 PCI, which deliver no-compromise, full MIMO transmit and receive performance. Atheros has taken system integration to a new level, driving refinements in XSPAN, the industry's most widely deployed 11n technology, to make the high-performance WLAN solution accessible in an even wider array of wireless products. The two new designs, which target the PC and broadband consumer premises equipment markets, integrate the MAC/baseband and radio transceiver, two enhanced MIMO power amplifiers and low noise amplifiers, and the transmit/receive switch, all onto a single chip. As a result of this extraordinary integration, these highly optimized and cost-effective designs will enable a new class of 11n products. The AR9227 single-chip PCI solution for the broadband networking market has been expressly designed for entry-level and mid-tier DSL, PON and other broadband-enabled APs, such as residential gateways and cable modems.
