Sony Integrates Atheros Communications Inc.'s WLAN Solutions.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced that Sony has integrated Atheros WLAN solutions with performance-boosting Super G(TM) and Super AG(TM) technology into a number of its new mobile computing products introduced this fall. In addition, the Atheros AR5005G, the world's first single-chip 802.11g solution, is now shipping in new note PC and desktop models from Sony. The low cost of Atheros' single-chip solution has allowed Sony to build wireless connectivity into even its most price-sensitive products. Sony has integrated the Atheros AR5005G chip into its VAIO E Series and K Series of laptops. Sony has selected the same WLAN solution for its new, integrated PC and TV offering the Sony VAIO VGC-V2S, a wide-screen all-in-one PC that features a TV. The innovative product was recently rolled out to European end-users.
