Atheros Communications Inc. Develops New Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Wi-Fi Direct Specification.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced that it applauds the Wi-Fi Alliance's development of the new Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Wi-Fi Direct specification, which enables wireless devices to connect to one another without traditional network infrastructure, enabling the easy transfer of content anytime, anywhere. Atheros' own peer-to-peer Wi-Fi(r) technology, Atheros Direct Connect, first demonstrated these benefits of device-to-device connectivity at the 2008 International Consumer Electronics Show and is now shipping in mobile consumer products. Direct Connect is fully future-compatible with the new Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Wi-Fi Direct specification. Atheros has enabled this innovative capability in its ROCm(r) Wi-Fi chips for mobile devices, currently shipping in smartphones featuring Direct Connect AP mode functionality. In the second half of 2009, Atheros also began shipping XSPAN(r) and Align(TM) 11n-based chips with Direct Connect, targeting PC applications.
