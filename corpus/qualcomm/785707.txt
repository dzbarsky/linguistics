Atheros Communications Launches World's First Single-Chip 802.11g Access Point Device.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the world's first IEEE 802.11g wireless access point on a chip, the Atheros AR5006AP-G. The AR5006AP-G represents a breakthrough in system integration, combining the wireless network processor, media access controller (MAC), baseband and radio functions into a single silicon chip. Atheros has also integrated many of the discrete components required by previous 802.11g access point designs. The transition from a two-chip design to a single-chip implementation produces substantial cost benefits. In addition, Atheros has reduced the rest of BOM (bill-of-materials) by almost 20%. Atheros achieved this integration without sacrificing the performance of the product-which is a major accomplishment. This highly integrated design will enable manufacturers to offer 802.11g-based consumer residential gateways at mass-market price points, while still delivering the industry's best throughput and range.
