Atheros Communications Inc. Launches Mobile Wlan Technology Rocm(r) Single-chip 11n Ar6003.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the launch of mobile WLAN technology, the ROCm(r) single-chip 11n AR6003 family. The AR6003 builds on the success of the industry-leading AR6002, combining the superior mobile WLAN throughput, range and energy efficiency of the ROCm technology with Atheros' Align(TM) 1-stream 11n market leadership and expertise. The result is a Wi-Fi(r) solution capable of up to 85Mbps of actual throughput, ideally suited to support demanding multimedia applications on smartphones, mobile gaming devices and other portable consumer electronics products. The AR6003 delivers actual end-user throughput up to four times that of mobile WLAN solutions based on 11g. With its 11n capabilities, the AR6003 achieves up to 48Mbps TCP/IP in the 2.4 GHz band in 20 MHz mode, and an unprecedented 85Mbps TCP/IP in 5 GHz in 40 MHz mode. The new ROCm AR6003 enhances its rate-over-range performance above the coverage improvements inherent in the 802.11n MAC and PHY, by leveraging advanced optional 11n feature
