Atheros Launches Single Chip Supporting All Three Modes.
Atheros launched a single chip supporting all three modes last month. But a chip called the UniFi-1 from UK Bluetooth pioneer Cambridge Silicon Radio could have a greater impact because it is designed to add tri-mode Wifi to mobile phones and PDAs. There will be more on this chip in next month's Personal Computer World/ The Atheros design comes in two flavours, the AR5413 and AR5414, which differ only in that the latter supports a proprietary 105Mbits/sec mode, with a claimed real throughout of around 60Mbits/sec. They come with modules called, respectively, the AR5006SX and R5006SX, which are small enough to fit on a mini-PCI or PC Card. They should ship this year, integrate a media access controller (MAC), a 2.4/5GHz transceiver, and a baseband processor. They also need fewer passive peripheral components than previous designs. Wifi 11a has a lower range than 11g - that is, data rates drop off more sharply with distance.
