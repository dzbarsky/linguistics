Atheros Communications Launches Smart-Antenna Wireless Chipset Delivering MIMO Performance to Standard 802.11 Products.
Atheros Communications Inc. introduced the new AR5005VL wireless solution that employs multiple-radio, smart-antenna technologies to deliver MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) performance and industry-leading throughput to standard 802.11 WLAN products. The AR5005VL chipset uses phased array beamforming, cyclic delay diversity, and optimal receive combining to deliver higher performance even when the new chipset is only on one end of a wireless connection. The new chipset therefore enables breakthrough performance with maximum compatibility for the millions of Wi-Fi products in the market. The AR5005VL chipset is available in both 802.11g and 802.11a/g versions, supporting configurations with up to four antennas.
