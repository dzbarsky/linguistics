Court Denies Kraft Foods Inc.' Request for Preliminary Injunction Against Starbucks Corporation.
Kraft Foods Inc. announced that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied Kraft's request for a preliminary injunction against Starbucks Corporation (Starbucks Coffee Company). Kraft Foods intends to appeal the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on an expedited basis. The injunction would have stopped Starbucks from its attempt to unilaterally end its strategic partnership with Kraft before the conclusion of an arbitration process that is required under the companies' long-standing contract. That arbitration process will continue over the next several months and is not affected by Court decision.
