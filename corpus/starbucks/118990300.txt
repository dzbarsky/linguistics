Starbucks Corporation Launches Starbucks VIA(R) Taste Promise.
Starbucks Corporation introduced the Starbucks VIA(R) Taste Promise, encouraging coffee drinkers to discover the great taste of Starbucks VIA(R) Ready Brew. Starbucks VIA(R) is 100% natural roasted arabica coffee in an instant form that is rich and full-bodied just like a fresh-brewed cup of Starbucks(R) coffee. The key to Starbucks VIA(R) is a proprietary, U.S. patent-pending microgrind technology that preserves the coffee's taste and quality. The introduction of the Starbucks VIA(R) Taste Promise further reinforces Starbucks belief that, with Starbucks VIA(R) Ready Brew, customers can enjoy a great premium single cup of instant coffee any time. Starbucks VIA(R) Ready Brew represents a broad and innovative coffee platform that recently surpassed $135 million in global sales for Starbucks since its launch.
