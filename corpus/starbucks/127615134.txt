U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Upheld Lower Court's Ruling Denying Kraft's Request for Preliminary Injunction Against Starbucks Corporation.
Kraft Foods announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a lower court's ruling denying Kraft's request for a preliminary injunction against Starbucks Corporation. The injunction would have stopped Starbucks from unilaterally ending its strategic partnership with Kraft before a mandatory arbitration proceeding decides the core issues in this dispute. The arbitration process is already underway and will continue over the next several months. Feb. 25, 2011 Court decision does not affect Kraft Foods' vigorous defense of its rights in arbitration. The Second Circuit did not rule on the fundamental issue of whether Starbucks can exit contract without paying the fair market value, plus a premium.
