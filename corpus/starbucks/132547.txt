Starbucks Coffee starts selling booze in Japan.
Starbucks Corporation Coffee has started to sell booze in one of its coffee shops in Japan but may expand to more outlets as it hopes to attract those who want something a bit stronger than cafe latte in the mornings. Naho Youda, a spokesperson for Starbucks Japan, said the company is modifying company policy that will enable the coffee chain to sell alcohol at selected shops.
