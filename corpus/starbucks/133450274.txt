Starbucks To Divest Two Pioneer Square Office Buildings.
Starbucks Corp intends to divest two Pioneer Square office buildings. The company had acquired 83 King Street in 2006, and began building adjacent 505 First Avenue South in 2007. In 2008, Starbucks decided that it no longer needed the 473,000 square feet of additional space and put the buildings up for lease. The offering brochure for 505 First and 83 King was circulated this month on Starbucks' behalf by Kinzer Real Estate Services and Eastdil Secured. Other downtown office buildings recently listed for sale include 36-story 1918 Eighth, 14-story 818 Stewart, 27-story Seattle Tower, the 21-story office tower at Westlake Center, and Regence Blue Shield's 16-story headquarters. For tax purposes, King County appraises 505 First at $53.9 million and 83 King at $23.7 million, which is about $5 million less than Starbucks paid for it, according to public records.
