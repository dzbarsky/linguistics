Starbucks Corporation Releases Statement in Response to the Proceedings in the New York State Supreme Court in Queens County.
Starbucks Corporation released a statement in response to the proceedings on June 15, 2011 in the New York State Supreme Court in Queens County pertaining to the company's decision to change dairy providers for the New York city market. The court will hold further hearings on June 27, 2011. In the meantime, Starbucks will work closely with its partners (employees), its local distributor and new dairy provider to ensure a seamless transition of the supply of dairy products to New York city stores. First and foremost, this move will result in no New York City job loss. In a court affidavit, the company's distributor, Bartlett, which contracts milk sourcing for Starbucks through Elmhurst, stated that Elmhurst advised it that 'if Elmhurst lost the Starbucks volume it would not have to lay anyone off, but rather it would merely cut the substantial overtime it is currently giving its workers'. In fact, Elmhurst's own court papers show that milk which Bartlett sells to Starbucks represents less than 10% of Elmhurst'
