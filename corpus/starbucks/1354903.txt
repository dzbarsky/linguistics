RBC Royal Bank & Starbucks Coffee Company Change the Canadian Credit Card Rewards World.
RBC Royal Bank (RBC) and Starbucks Coffee Company have introduced a new hybrid card that blends an RBC Visa card with the re-loadable Starbucks Card. Starbucks Duetto(xx) Visa(x) Card - the first of its kind in Canada - offers coffee-loving consumers the ability to pay, reload, earn and redeem rewards with one card. The Starbucks Duetto Visa Card rolls the popular Starbucks Card and RBC Visa card into one. When cardholders use the Visa account of their Duetto(xx) Card, they earn 1% of their purchase back in Duetto(xx) Dollars which are loaded into a Duetto Dollars account at the end of each billing cycle. Duetto Dollars can then be used for purchases at Starbucks, including beverages, food and store merchandise. Using the Duetto Dollars account in Starbucks stores qualifies cardholders to earn additional rewards. New cardholders also receive a one-time pre-load of $10 to their Starbucks Card account after their first Duetto Card Visa purchase, and qualify for quarterly gifts and benefits.
