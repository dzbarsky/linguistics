Starbucks Corp. to Open 1,500 Stores This Year.
Starbucks Corp. plans to add about 1,500 new locations this year as the retailer steps up openings in the face of slowing sales gains at older stores. Sales at stores open at least 13 months will rise as much as 7% this year, down from 10% last year and a return to the company's normal pace.
