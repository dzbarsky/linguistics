Starbucks Opens Caf/Business Center at Dallas Airport Terminal.
The first of eight Starbucks Corp. cafe/business centers opened in Terminal C, offering travelers a comfortable place to do business on the fly. By pairing a Starbucks and a business center, D/FW officials hope to create de facto cybercafes below the Skylink people-mover platforms in Terminals A, B, C and E.
