Starbucks Coffee Expands in Oklahoma.
Starbucks Coffee is expanding in Oklahoma. The Seattle-based coffee company is building three stores in Oklahoma City, but they are also looking at Lawton, Stillwater and Enid. In Oklahoma City, construction is under way on stores on the northwest corner of Northwest Expressway and Independence, and on the southeast corner of Interstate 240 and Pennsylvania Avenue. On the southeast corner of Northwest Expressway and McArthur, Starbucks will occupy an existing building. All three drive-through locations should open by midsummer and employ about 17 people each, Voss said. The new Starbucks will bring a total of 11 stores in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area and 17 across the state.
