Starbuck reports first quarter 2002 profits and expects yearly profits;announces to open new stores in 2002.
"Starbucks Corporation beat Wall Street expectations and posted a record first-quarter profit. A one-time $13.4 million gain from the October initial public offering of Starbucks Coffee Japan helped the Seattle-based specialty-coffee giant post a profit of $68.4 million, or 17 cents a share, for the quarter ended Dec. 30, up 40 percent from $49 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. Minus the IPO proceeds, which amounted to 2 cents a share, profit increased by 22 percent and matched analyst estimates of 15 cents a share. Total sales for the quarter rose 21 percent to $805.3 million, with sales at stores open at least a year increasing 2 percent. Starbucks also said it would open at least 1,200 new stores in fiscal 2002 and plans to identify four new international markets by year's end -- two in Europe, one in Asia and its first in Latin America."
