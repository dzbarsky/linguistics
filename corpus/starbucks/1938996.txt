Starbucks Corp. and Virgin Records to Release CD of Rare Rolling Stones Remixes.
Starbucks Corp. and Virgin Records are co-releasing a CD of rare Rolling Stones remixes, B-sides and hard-to-find live recordings. Rarities: 1971-2003 will be released in Starbucks stores and in other retail outlets in the United States and Canada on November 22, 2005. The coffee company's music arm, Starbucks Hear Music, worked with the record label and the veteran British rockers to comb through the band's extensive archives. Among the 16 tracks: a cover of Chuck Berry's Let it Rock, originally released as a B-side to the 1971 single Brown Sugar, and alternate takes of several of the band's biggest hits, including live versions of Tumbling Dice, Wild Horses and Beast of Burden, and a dance remix of Miss You.
