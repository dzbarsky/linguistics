Starbucks Plans to Locate Six Coffee Shops Within Walking Distance of Each Other in Dublin's City Centre.
Starbucks is expected to have up to six coffee shops within walking distance of each other in Dublin's city centre by the middle of next year, but property experts claim intense competition for retail outlets in the capital has slowed down the US multinational's expansion plans. Several weeks ago Starbucks unveiled its first Irish store at the Dundrum Town Centre and another two outlets are due to open in the coming weeks at the Blanchardstown centre and in the Harcourt building at Harcourt Street. However, the coffee chain had originally planned to first launch its flagship store at College Green but was held up by claims the company's presence would dumb down an historic part of the city.
