Judge Sides with Starbucks in Name Dispute.
Starbucks Corp. announced that a federal judge ruled that the name Sambuck's above a hole-in-the-wall coffee shop is too similar to it and must be changed. Owner Sam Buck named the store after herself. She opened it in 2000, before Astoria had a Starbucks. She got a cease-and-desist letter from the Seattle-based company in March of 2002.
