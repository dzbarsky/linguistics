Starbucks Wins Trademark Dispute with Shanghai Xingbake.
"Starbucks Corp. won a trademark victory in China as a Shanghai court ruled that Shanghai Xingbake Coffee Shop infringed the trademark rights of the Seattle coffee-retailing giant. The China company had been using a variation of the Starbucks logo and the name Xing Ba Ke, a transliteration of Starbucks in Chinese characters. In Chinese, xing -- pronounced shing -- means star, and ba ke sounds like bucks. The court ordered Shanghai Xingbake to pay Starbucks $62,000."
