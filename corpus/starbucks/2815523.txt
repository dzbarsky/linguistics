Starbucks to Launch New Iced Coffee Drinks.
Starbucks to launch new iced coffee drinks. The new Starbucks Iced Coffee range includes Starbucks Italian Roast coffee. Available in both regular and light versions, the product is currently available in Starbucks retail stores and will hit convenience and grocery stores across the US on April 24, 2006. In addition to the launch of Starbucks Iced Coffee, the North American Coffee Partnership has also introduced two line extensions within its bottled Starbucks Frappuccino and Starbucks DoubleShot brands. Starbucks Strawberries and Creme Frappuccino creme drink, a smooth blend of real strawberries and low-fat milk, is the first coffee-free bottled Starbucks Frappuccino creme drink, inspired by the most popular non-coffee blended beverage in Starbucks retail stores.
