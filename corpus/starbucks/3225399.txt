Starbucks Loses Trademark Dispute with Elpreya.
Starbucks Corp. has lost a trademark dispute with a local company which called its products 'Starpreya,'. The South Korean patent court ruled against Starbucks, which had filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit against the firm Elpreya. Starbucks claimed Elpreya's use of the brand 'Starpreya' causes local consumers to confuse the product with its own corporate and brand name. The Intellectual Property Tribunal ruled that the trade names were too dissimilar to be confused.
