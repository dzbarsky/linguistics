Indiana Couple Files a Lawsuit Against Starbucks Corp.
Starbucks Corp. announced that an Indiana couple has filed a lawsuit against the company alleging that the company was negligent when it served them a hot chocolate that burned their young daughter. The lawsuit filed in Marion County Superior Court, claims Rachel Brennan was severely burned two years ago when the drink spilled on her lap. The girl's parents, Michael and Alexis Brennan, said Starbucks erroneously served their daughter an adult hot chocolate instead of a child's hot chocolate, which was supposed to be prepared at a lower temperature.
