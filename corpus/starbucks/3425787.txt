Starbucks Sells Pre-Lent Pastries.
Starbucks Corp. announced that its stores will sell the deep-fried jelly-filled doughnuts. The paczki -- a popular Polish pre-Lenten pastry -- is putting in an appearance for patrons at about 60 area Starbucks outlets. Paczkis are customary on the eve of Lent, the 40-day period of self-denial that Christians observe before Easter. A paczki (POONCH'-kee) packs lots of calories. Starbucks is offering them with apple cinnamon, raspberry and Bavarian cream fillings for 95 cents. Starbucks said it will take orders for boxes of six for pickup on Fat February 20, the day before Lent.
