Starbucks Eyes Buys.
Starbucks is seeking acquisitions to grow its business. Our solid balance sheet, continuing strong cash flows and borrowing capacity allow us to continue to fund the growth of our existing businesses, selectively invest in new growth opportunities, such as our recent acquisition of 90% ownership in our Beijing operations, and opportunistically repurchase shares, the company said in a statement.
