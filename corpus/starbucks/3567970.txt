Starbucks Coffee (Starbucks Corp.) and Potbelly Sandwich Works recently opened in the 26,500-square-foot park, while Fuddruckers and Bertucci's are expected to open later this year. There's 6,500 square feet still available for another restaurant. The restaurant park, also including an IHOP that opened late last year and the Bungalow Ale House, was developed by Keane Enterprises.

The park is part of a 25-acre mixed use project that includes a 57,000-square-foot office building currently being pre-leased and 75,000 square feet of condominiums in four buildings that were completed second quarter 2006.
