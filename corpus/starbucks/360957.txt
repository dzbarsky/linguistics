Starbucks Coffee Co. announced the Summer Heat Relief Tour 2002, which will take place in select cities across North America throughout the summer. A completely redesigned fleet of Starbucks Chill Patrol vehicles will comb summer festivals, beaches and city streets to resuscitate taste buds with samples of indulgent and refreshing blended drinks--absolutely free. Since 1999, the fleet has grown to 12 vehicles and visits summer events in select cities across North America. This year, the vehicles feature a vibrant new design reminiscent of summer and the new blended beverages found at Starbucks retail stores.
