Starbucks Corp. Is Offering Wireless Internet Access.
Starbucks Corp. has been at the vanguard of offering wireless Internet access in the popular Wi-Fi format, with wireless hot spots in about 2,600 of its 4,100 stores in the United States as a way to encourage customers to come in, log on and hang out. Anticipating the day when Wi-Fi alone may not distinguish one retailer from another, Starbucks is experimenting with the equivalent of Wi-Fi flavors of the month.
