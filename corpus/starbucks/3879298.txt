The National Labor Relations Board Sets Hearing into Starbucks Corp. Illegally Kept Workers from Unionizing at Four of its Manhattan Coffee Shops.
The National Labor Relations Board set a hearing into whether Starbucks Corp. illegally kept workers from unionizing at four of its Manhattan coffee shops. The labor board alleged that Starbucks violated labor laws 30 times by engaging in unfair labor practices, based on a complaint filed by the Industrial Workers of the World. The labor board said 11 managers at New York Starbucks were involved in firing two workers who supported unionizing, threatening to fire others and prohibiting employees from discussing working conditions with other employees while at work. A hearing before an administrative law judge of the labor board is scheduled for June 12. If Starbucks is found guilty, it could be required to rehire the two fired workers and publicly state that it won't illegally suppress union activity.
