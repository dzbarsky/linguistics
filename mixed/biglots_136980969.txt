Big Lots Reportedly Gets Buyout Interest.
Big Lots Inc. is exploring a possible sale after receiving interest from buyout firms, said two people with knowledge of the situation. Big Lots Inc. was approached by Thomas H. Lee Partners L.P. (THL) and Bain Capital LLC, said one person, who declined to be identified because the matter is private. The shares climbed 15% on February 7, 2011 in New York, giving Big Lots a market value of about $3 billion. Big Lots is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to study strategic options.  Bloomberg added that, executives at Big Lots didnt return phone calls seeking comment. Matt Benson, a spokesman for THL, and Alex Stanton, a spokesman for Bain, declined to comment.
