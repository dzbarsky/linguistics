EPA Proposes $116,150 Penalty Against Big Lots for Selling Mislabeled and Unregistered Pesticide Products.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 5 has filed an administrative complaint against Big Lots Inc., Columbus, Ohio, for distributing and selling unregistered pesticide products. A $116,150 penalty is proposed. An Illinois Department of Public Health inspector found two unregistered pesticide products, Insect Coil Burner and eight Mosquito Repellant Coils, at a Big Lots store in Glendale Heights, Ill. In addition, Big Lots sold the chlorpyrifos-containing pesticide Ortho Borer and Leaf Miner Spray even though its registration had been canceled in June 2002. Finally, Big Lots sold Lysol Brand II Disinfectant, a product that did not have a required complete English language pesticide label containing directions for use.
