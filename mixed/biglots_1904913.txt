Big Lots Inc. to Close Up to 170 Underperforming Stores.
Big Lots Inc. announced that it will close up to 170 underperforming stores, or 11% of its total, by the end of the year to bolster companywide performance. The targeted stores are mostly in the Midwest and the company said they have turned marginal performances and are mostly located in sparsely populated markets. The company previously announced that it would close about 40 stores this year before a store-by-store review turned up an additional 85 closeout stores and 41 standalone furniture stores that weren't meeting the mark. The closings could affect up to 30 employees per store, although that number varies depending on location.
