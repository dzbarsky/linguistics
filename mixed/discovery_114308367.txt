Discovery Communications, Inc., Hasbro Inc. to Launch Kids Channel.
Discovery Communications, Inc. and Hasbro's new television channel, The Hub, will debut this Sunday at 10 a.m. ET. In April 2009 Hasbro paid Discovery $300 million to enter a 50/50 partnership to produce a network geared towards children between the ages of 6 and 11. The Hub will replace the Discovery Kids channel this weekend and will reach approximately 60 million U.S. homes with cable and satellite.
