Discovery Communications Mulls Acquisitions.
Discovery Communications, Inc. may look at acquisitions. Senior EVP and CFO, Brad Singer said, In terms of how we think about our capital and allocation and what we want to do with our money, our number one priority is investing in our core business. That is where we would prefer to put our money to work. And whether that is organic or looking at things, acquisitions or things to make investments that actually enhance shareholder value, that is where we would really like to spend capital.
