Heinz Updates On Acquisition Plans.
HJ Heinz Co. is looking for acquisitions in the emerging markets. CEO William Johnson has stated, "We're going to continue to push aggressively in terms of incremental investment into the emerging markets, the only markets that are showing sustainable growth in all the countries we operate in and where consumers are becoming increasingly confident. We are not spending much time looking for M&A opportunities in the United States and Western Europe. Our focus is almost entirely on the emerging world."
