Delhi High Court Rejects PepsiCo's Appeal against Heinz.
The Delhi High Court rejected an appeal filed by PepsiCo against HJ Heinz Co. over alleged trademark infringement. PepsiCo India had filed a lawsuit against the makers of Heinz which makes Complan and Glucon-D in the Delhi High Court in March 2010, alleging that Heinz's Glucon-D Isotonik use similar a tagline as PepsiCo's Gatorade sports drink. The Court has held that the words rehydrate, replenish and refuel are commonly used to describe the character and quality of an isotonic drink and no one can therefore claim monopoly over them.
