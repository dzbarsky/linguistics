Unite Union Employed at HJ Heinz Co. Reject Wage Deal.
Members of the Unite union employed at HJ Heinz Co. have rejected the company's improved pay offer. The Unite union workers have agreed to stop the strike planned for January 11, 2011 until after the vote, but members' rejection indicates the 24-hour walkout will go ahead. The wage deal included a 3.5% annual pay increase for the contract's first year. It was agreed on last week by union leaders and the company management.
