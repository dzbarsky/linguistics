Heinz Reportedly Close To Acquire Or Merge Quero Alimentos.
HJ Heinz Co. is in advanced stages of talks for an acquisition or merger with Coniexpress S.A. Ind?strias Aliment?cias (Quero Alimentos) that could be worth up to BRL 1 billion, a Brazilian newspaper reported. Citing an unnamed executive with knowledge of the talks, Valor Economico said Heinz planned to acquire or partner with Quero Alimentos. Heinz currently has no direct operations in Brazil and sells products such as its trademark ketchup through import distributors, Valor said. Heinz Chief Executive Officer William Johnson said on February 24, 2011 that emerging markets would make up as much of a third of the company's sales in about five years. "I have never seen more M&A opportunities in emerging markets than I am seeing now," Johnson said. Heinz declined to comment and no one was immediately available at Quero Alimentos to comment on the report to Reuters.
