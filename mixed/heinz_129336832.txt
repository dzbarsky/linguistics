Heinz Seeks Acquisitions.
HJ Heinz Co. reaffirmed that it is looking for acquisitions, including in infant nutrition. CFO Art Winkleblack said Heinz was looking for more "bolt-on" acquisitions. Winkleblack said Heinz would consider any type of deal in infant nutrition but suggested that smaller acquisitions would be more likely. "Our sweet-spot is bolt-on acquisitions. We are also very willing to look at large ones but [those deals] would have to make a lot of sense," Winkleblack said.
