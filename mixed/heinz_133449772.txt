HJ Heinz Co. Cuts 344 Australian Jobs.
HJ Heinz Co. has slashed more than 340 Australian jobs as it shifts some production to New Zealand. The company is closing its tomato sauce factory in Girgarre in northern Victoria at the expense of 146 jobs, while 160 beetroot-processing jobs will go at its subsidiary Golden Circle's Northgate plant in Brisbane. Another 38 jobs will be cut when meals production ceases at the Heinz factory in Wagga Wagga in NSW, but the plant, which employs 113 people, will remain open to continue producing canned meat. As well as the 160 jobs at Northgate, the Golden Circle decision leaves nine beetroot growers in the flood-hit Lockyer Valley, west of Brisbane, without their main source of income.
