Illumina Inc. Receives FDA 510(K) Clearance for its BeadXpress(R) Multiplex Analysis System.
Illumina Inc. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted 510(k) market clearance for the company's BeadXpress system for multiplex genetic analysis. According to the FDA's indications of use, the BeadXpress system -- consisting of Illumina's BeadXpress Reader and VeraScan software -- is an in-vitro diagnostic device intended for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes in a DNA sample utilizing VeraCode holographic microbead technology. Illumina introduced the BeadXpress system in 2007 with Research Use Only kits for custom genotyping, gene expression, methylation and protein analysis. Since then it has been adopted by research, agricultural, industrial and pharmaceutical institutions worldwide. Utilizing uniquely inscribed digital microbeads, VeraCode technology provides high-quality data, broad multiplexing capability and assay flexibility. Illumina submitted the system for FDA review in September 2009.
