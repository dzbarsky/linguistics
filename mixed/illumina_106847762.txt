Illumina Announces First Customer Shipments of Omni2.5 BeadChip.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has begun shipping its new HumanOmni2.5-Quad DNA Analysis BeadChip (Omni2.5). This microarray contains millions of newly discovered genome-wide common and rare variants from the 1,000 Genomes Project (1kGP), selected to maximize its ability to detect new associations. Omni2.5 represents a significant milestone in Illumina's 2010 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) roadmap, announced in late 2009, that is providing access to superior common and rare variant content as it is deployed from the 1kGP. Omni2.5 delivers unprecedented genome coverage for both SNP and copy number variation (CNV) analysis, while retaining the industry leading data quality and simple workflow that has made Infinium arrays the gold standard GWAS analysis tool. Omni2.5 is delivered in a high-throughput 4-sample format for a total of approximately 10 million markers per array, providing immediate utility for the next-generation of GWAS. It is compatible with an iScan or HiScan System. In addition, the com
