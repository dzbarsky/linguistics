Covaris, Inc. Signs Co-Marketing Agreement with Illumina Inc. to Combine Next-Gen Sequencing Platforms with Controlled DNA Shearing.
Covaris Inc. announced that it has signed a co-marketing agreement with Illumina, Inc. making Covaris DNA shearing technologies the recommended method of shearing with Illumina next-generation sequencing product lines, including HiSeq, HiScanSQ, and Genome Analyzer. In addition, the proprietary Covaris process enables higher recoveries for nucleic acid extraction, tissue homogenization, chromatin shearing, protein digestion, and cell lysis. The highly controlled Covaris technology is isothermal and non-contact, ensuring molecular stability throughout the sample preparation process. Important for next-generation genetic analysis, the Covaris system allows customers to rapidly and precisely scale up sample processing capability. The Illumina-Covaris partnership will bring industry leading next-generation DNA shearing performance to Illumina's sequencing customers.
