Illumina Inc. Introduces TruSeq(TM) Sample Prep and Exome Enrichment Kits.
Illumina Inc. announced TruSeq sample preparation kits for DNA, RNA, and small RNA applications and the TruSeq Exome Enrichment Kit, for use across the company's portfolio of sequencing platforms. TruSeq sequencing reagents provide a streamlined workflow that is economical and scalable, delivering industry-leading accuracy for sequencing studies. TruSeq Sample Prep kits feature master-mixed reagents and optimized adapter design, making the industry's most simplified sequencing workflow even easier. TruSeq Exome Enrichment kits, used with TruSeq DNA Sample Prep kits, enable large-scale exome studies using a pre-enrichment pooling approach with plate-based processing of up to 96 samples. TruSeq solutions provide: Coverage of greater than 62 Mb of the human exome, with an industry-leading price of less than $300 per sample enrichment. A flexible approach for single-end, paired-end, and multiplexed sequencing with as much as 80% reduction in price for sample prep. Sequencing-based gene expression studies with ric
