Illumina Inc. Introduces the Next Generation of iSelect(R) Custom Genotyping.
Illumina Inc. announced its next generation of iSelect custom genotyping products that allow researchers to design custom arrays containing from 3,000 up to 1,000,000 markers, with the flexibility to add supplemental content to their array designs. The additional marker and add-on content capabilities enable researchers to draw on the latest advances from genome-wide association studies, next-generation whole-genome sequencing, and exome sequencing studies for variant confirmation, fine mapping, and target validation. Next generation iSelect also delivers the flexibility in plexity, pricing, and content that applied markets need to transition to the latest genomic tools.
