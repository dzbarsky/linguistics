Illumina Inc. Announces MiSeq(TM) Personal Sequencing System.
Illumina Inc. announced MiSeq(TM), a low-cost personal sequencing system that provides individual researchers a platform with rapid turnaround time, unmatched accuracy, and radically improved ease of use. Leveraging the company's TruSeq(TM) sequencing chemistry, the system's revolutionary workflow offers the flexibility to go from purified DNA to analyzed data in as few as eight hours, or to generate in excess of 1 gigabase per run in slightly over a day. Expected to be priced under $125,000 with individual run prices ranging from $400-$750, MiSeq will be the most affordable next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform available. Using Illumina's proven TruSeq chemistry, MiSeq provides users the flexibility to optimize run conditions to suit their particular applications. Like all other Illumina sequencing platforms, MiSeq performs both single and paired-end runs with read lengths of up to 2 x 150 base pairs. The ability to support paired-end reads is critical for a broad range of applications including amplicon
