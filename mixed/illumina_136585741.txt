Helicos Biosciences Corp. Files Lawsuit Against Life Technologies Corporation, Illumina Inc. and Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. for Patent Infringement.
Helicos Biosciences Corp. is suing those big competitors Life Technologies Corporation, Illumina Inc. and Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. for patent infringement. The complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in September, alleges the defendants infringed on five Helicos patents which relate to DNA sequencing-by-synthesis, which expire between 2019 and 2024. The suit originally named only Pacific Biosciences, but a month later Life and Illumina were added as defendants. The suit is seeking injunctive relief and damages, but it may result in a settlement involving one or more of the defendants licensing the technology from Helicos, hopefully at a high enough price to keep the company going.
