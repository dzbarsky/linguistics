University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences Joins Illumina Genome Network.
Illumina Inc. announced that the University of Washington (UW) Department of Genome Sciences has joined the Illumina Genome Network (IGN). IGN is a global partnership designed to link researchers seeking large-scale whole human genome sequencing services with leading institutions that provide such services using Illumina's sequencing technology. Recent advancements in Illumina HiSeq(TM) sequencing system technology have enabled the company to lower the price for the service to $5,000 per genome for projects of 10 samples or more, and $4,000 for projects of 50 samples or more. By offering the speed, accuracy and high-quality data researchers require at price points they can afford, the Illumina Genome Network has raised the bar on whole human genome sequencing services.
