Kimberly-Clark Mulls Acquisitions In Russia.
Kimberly-Clark Corporation said that the company may consider acquisition opportunities in Russia. Kimberly-Clark is looking to expand in Russia, China, Latin America, Australia, South Korea and Israel, it said on May 13. Russia is a key part of international expansion, Kimberly-Clark said on June 2. Robert Black, President of Kimberly-Clarks international division said, Kimberly-Clark may consider acquisitions in areas of Russia where it isnt present. The first preference is to grow organically. We look for mergers and acquisitions in areas where we may need to acquire different skills or technologies or enter a new category. There may be more potential for acquisitions in areas outside child and feminine care, he added.
