For the period, the company's net sales increased 1.3% to $4.979 billion against $4.913 billion a year ago. Diluted net income per share was $1.14 compared with $1.40 in 2009. Although performance benefited from organic top-line volume growth and significant cost savings, bottom-line results declined, primarily due to cost inflation of $265 million. Operating profit was $698 million, down 20% from $871 million a year ago. Cash provided by operations totaled $745 million compared to $791 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower cash earnings and a smaller level of improvement in working capital compared to the prior year, mostly offset by lower pension plan contributions. Capital spending was $248 million compared with $167 million in 2009. Operating profit was $698 million against $871 million a year ago. Income before income taxes and equity interests
