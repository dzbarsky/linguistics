Kimberly-Clark Corporation to Axe 170 Full-Time and 35 Part-Time Jobs.
Kimberly-Clark Corporation decided to axe 170 full-time and 35 part-time jobs from May. The company announced the cuts were a result of a high Australian dollar and high energy prices which made it hard to compete against imports. Kimberly-Clark says 370 people will still be employed at the Millicent mill and the axed staff will be paid their full entitlements. There will also be 65 jobs lost at the company's Tantanoola pulp mill unless a buyer can be found.
