Molex Inc. Showcases Safety Lamp for Open Rated Temporary Hid Light Fixtures At Lightfair.
Molex Inc. has announced the development of its Woodhead Safety Lamp for high-bay fixtures, the electrical industry's first safety lamp to meet the requirements for an open rated fixture (Type-O), the new Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA2007), and the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR1040.30) revised in 2008. The high-intensity discharge (HID) lamp includes a self-extinguishing feature (Type T) that will permanently disable the lamp after minutes of operation once the glass envelope is broken. The company said the lamp is ideal for temporary lighting in harsh environments such as construction and maintenance sites that require the high performance of metal halide lamps. Open rated lamps in harsh conditions, such as construction sites, have minimal protection, are often exposed to flying construction debris and are frequently transported from one site to another. Frequently, when lamps are damaged, it is not catastrophic and workers will continue using them, exposing themselves and others to harmfu
