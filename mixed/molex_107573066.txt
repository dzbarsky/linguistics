Molex Inc. Launches Solarspec(TM) Junction Box for Silicon Photovoltaic (PV) Solar Panels.
Molex Inc. has released the SolarSpec(TM) Junction Box and Cable Assemblies designed for installation on the back of mono- and polycrystalline photovoltaic (PV) solar modules. The products provide the interface between the conductor ribbons on the panel and the DC I/O cables. Molex SolarSpec solutions are specifically designed for applications in the solar and renewable energy industry. The SolarSpec Junction Box features spring terminals connecting the base directly to the PV ribbon conductors, without need for retention clamps or clips. Optional patented Solder Charge Technology(TM) facilitates high-speed assembly and eliminates the need for hand-soldering of the ribbon, significantly reducing any process variation. Optional double-sided tape removes the need for curing time on silicone when attaching the connector base to a module. The compact dimensional profile can supply current ratings comparable with traditional larger products. The SolarSpec Junction Box assembly is supplied with two removable DC cab
