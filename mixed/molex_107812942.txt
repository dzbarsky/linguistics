Molex Mulls Acquisitions.
Molex Inc. intends to look at acquisition opportunities. At RBC Capital Markets North American Technology, Media & Communications Conference, Steve Martens, Companys VP of IR said: Acquisitions is another part of our growth mix. Typically we look at smaller companies. We did do a large acquisition about four years ago. Large for us is perhaps $250 million in revenue, but generally we're looking at smaller companies, in the $15 million to $50 million range. We've done two or three per year over the last couple of years, even during the downturn.
