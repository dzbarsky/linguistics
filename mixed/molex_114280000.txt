Molex Announces New Mini-LC Duplex Cabling Solutions to Support Avago Technologies' Mini-SFP Transceiver Line.
Molex Inc. announced its new Mini-LC Duplex Cables, which are designed to mate with Avago Technologies' Mini-SFP transceiver. The assemblies were developed with a reduced ferrule pitch over standard LC duplex connectors to enable a higher density deployment of active devices per blade and a cleaner cable-management solution when mated with Avago Technologies' Mini-SFP transceiver. Ideal for data communications and networking applications, the Mini-LC Duplex cables come in standard lengths of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 meters with variations that include Mini-LC to Mini-LC cables as well as Mini-LC to standard LC duplex cables. Molex also offers custom lengths and fiber optic breakout cables if transitions are needed from MPO based QSFP modules to Mini-SFP transceivers supported by Avago Technologies. Additional product features include: Utilizes 50/125um OM3 fiber for longer reach and higher speeds optimized at 850nm or 1300nm; Complies with RoHS requirements meeting EU environmental requirements for electronic equipm
