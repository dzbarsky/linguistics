Molex Inc. Announces Development of the New Brad(R) SST(TM) PB3 Remote Module for PROFIBUS.
Molex Inc. announced the development of the new Brad(R) SST(TM) PB3 Remote Module for PROFIBUS, which will be showcased at Automation Fair(R), November 3-4, Molex booth 1028. This stand-alone hardware platform includes PROFIBUS and Ethernet communication ports, enabling fast and easy connectivity to any Rockwell ControlLogix(R) and CompactLogix(R) controller. The module will be available in the second quarter CY2011 and feature a unique remote design that allows the PB3 module to be installed closest to the PROFIBUS field device, reducing the expensive cabling costs that occur when the controller and field device are located apart from one another. The PB3 Remote Module fits factory automation, process control and machine building applications. Additional features include: Engineering console that runs PROFIBUS master and slave protocols simultaneously; Remote configuration and diagnostics via an Ethernet connection for quick commissioning; CommDTM driver, which allows Rockwell users in process control indust
