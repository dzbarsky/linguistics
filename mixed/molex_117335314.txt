Molex Inc. Introduces its Second Generation Sealed, Hybrid, High-Density and Modular Connector System.
Molex Inc. has introduced its second generation sealed, hybrid, high-density and modular connector system. The CMX family uses a new CTX terminal system with a fully protected seal to deliver the ultimate in sealing performance. The CMX connector system is ideal for transportation powertrain applications, such as those found in engine control units, automatic gear boxes, suspension controllers and electrical parking brakes. The first two circuit sizes of the CMX family, which meet the demands of the transportation market, is a compact 5-row 55-circuit CMX connector and a 5-row 65-circuit CMX connector. Further circuit sizes to extend the family are in development. Both CMX connectors support low and medium current using 0.635mm (0.025") and 1.50mm (0.059") CTX terminals. The new matte seal is designed for the ultimate high performing sealing function of the CTX terminals and can be used with ISO and JASO wires. The CTX terminal system features a clean-body type design that performs well in harsh environments,
