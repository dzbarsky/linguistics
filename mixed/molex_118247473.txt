Molex Inc. Announces IllumiMate Wire-To-Board Connector System.
Molex Inc. introduced the IllumiMate(TM) wire-to-board connector system, designed to meet the low-power needs of thin-screen LED TVs and other compact devices. IllumiMate has a 2.00mm (0.079") pitch, 4.05mm (0.159") mated height and 6.35mm (0.250") width. The LED lights for an LED TV can be located on a bus-bar across the middle of the screen or, as in some of the newest models, on the edge of the panel in order to avoid shadowing. When placed on the edge, space savings become more critical in order to achieve the thinnest screen. IllumiMate offers the narrowest width of any similar low-power connector system currently available on the market, along with significant cost and performance advantages. IllumiMate connectors feature a robust dual-positive locking design, which includes locking windows for visual lock confirmation and a user-friendly latch, to ensure secure mating. Other key features of the Molex IllumiMate family include a dual-contact terminal design for secure electrical contact, wide solder tab
