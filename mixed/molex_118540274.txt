Molex Inc. to Demonstrate New Additions to its Impact Connector System in Booth 501 at DesignCon 2011.
Molex Inc. will demonstrate new additions to its Impact(TM) Connector System in Booth 501 at DesignCon 2011, February 1 - 2, Santa Clara, CA. The company's Impact products meet marketplace demands for high-speed, high-density connectors while providing the ultimate in signal integrity and design flexibility. The Impact Orthogonal Direct Connector and Impact Plus 85-Ohm Backplane Connector both include new design enhancements and additional configurations, further expanding options for engineers. The standard Impact Backplane Connector System provides data rates up to 25 Gbps and features a simple 1.90 by 1.35mm (0.075 by 0.053") grid on both backplane and daughtercard, increasing PCB routing flexibility while reducing complexity and costs. The products also include a broad-edge-coupled transmission technology, enabling low cross-talk and high-signal bandwidth while minimizing channel-performance variation across every differential pair within the system. In addition to their overall design characteristics, th
