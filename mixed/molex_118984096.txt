Molex Inc. Introduces Z-Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable Plus Interconnect Solution.
Molex Inc. introduced the z-Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable Plus (zQSFP+) interconnect solution, designed for high-density applications found in telecommunications, data networking, test and measurement and medical diagnostic equipment. The zQSFP+ system, which provides proven 25 Gbps data rates, will be demonstrated in Molex booth 501 at DesignCon 2011, February 1 and 2, Santa Clara, CA. The products support next-generation 100 Gbps Ethernet and 100 Gbps InfiniBand Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) applications and are designed to accommodate stacked and ganged connector configurations in extremely high-density requirements. Components of the system include: Surface Mount (SMT) Through Hole Connector: Molex's zQSFP+ SMT EDR application consists of 4 lanes of high data-rate differential signals with proven data rates of 25 Gbps and capable data rates of 40 Gbps. The patent-pending preferential coupling design uses insert molding to support a narrow edge-coupled blanked and formed contact geometry to optimize electric
