Molex Inc. Announces Newest Additions to iPass+(TM) Product Family.
Molex Inc. announced its newest additions to the iPass+(TM) product family. The iPass+ High-Speed Channel (HSC) CXP copper and optical system offers connectors and cables that achieve rates of up to 120 Gbps of pluggable data over 12 lanes in one assembly. The first-to-market technology will be on display in Molex booth 501 at DesignCon 2011, February 1 and 2, Santa Clara, CA. This dual paddle-card system was adopted as the InfiniBand CXP 12x QDR standard and by IEEE 802.3ba as the 100G Ethernet standard, providing 10 lanes of 10 Gbps data rates. The company has leveraged the latest high data-rate capable wafer technology and compliant-pin tails to develop two integrated connector offerings for the growing server-storage market: The enhanced footprint version is a high-density, 10-channel connector, which conforms to IEEE 802.3ba requirements for the 10-channel 100 Gigabit Ethernet interface and provides a path to future terabit networks. The standard version is a high-density, 12-channel connector capable of
