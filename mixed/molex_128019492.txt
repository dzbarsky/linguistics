Molex Inc. to Demonstrate High-Speed Differential Signal Transmission at Ethernet Technology Summit.
Molex Inc. will showcase next-generation high-speed technology at the Ethernet Technology Summit being held February 23 and 24 in the Santa Clara Marriott, Santa Clara, CA. Molex will demonstrate a live 25 Gbps differential transmission system incorporating the new zQSFP+ SMT connector and utilizing a National Semiconductor transceiver and 25 Gbps Bert Scope to present transmission performance via eye pattern for a 3-meter passive cable. Designed for high-density applications found in telecommunications, data networking, test and measurement, and medical diagnostic equipment, the zQSFP+ system supports next-generation 100 Gbps Ethernet and 100 Gbps Infiniband Enhanced Data Rate applications. The Molex Active Optical zQSFP+ Cable (AOC) transmits 28 Gbps data rates up to 4Km with excellent thermal cooling, signal integrity, electro-magnetic interference protection, and the lowest known optical power consumption in the industry. A first-to-market technology, the iPass copper and optical system offers connectors
