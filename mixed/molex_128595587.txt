Molex Inc. Introduces QSFP+ Active Optical Cable Assemblies.
Molex Inc. introduced its Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable (QSFP+) Active Optical Cable (AOC) assemblies, providing a link distance and lowest power consumption. The assemblies, which will be demonstrated at OFC/NFOEC 2011, March 8 - 10, Los Angeles, CA, Molex booth 1908, achieve 40 Gbps data rates over long reaches of up to 4km (2.49 miles) using only 0.78W per cable end. By improving overall data center power consumption, additional ports can be deployed, resulting in increased connectivity options and overall cost savings. Adding to Molex's QSFP+ AOC assemblies' high-performance capabilities is the use of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Photonics technology, which integrates most of the transceiver functionality onto a single chip, providing a low-cost cable that delivers a long-reach solution. With four bi-directional optical data links per end, each operating at data rates from 1.0 to 10.3125 Gbps, the Company noted that the Molex QSFP+ AOC assemblies are compatible with multiple protocols
