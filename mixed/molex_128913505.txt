Molex Inc. Releases Next Generation of Brad(R) mPm(R) DIN Valve Connectors.
Molex Inc. has released the next generation of Brad(R) mPm(R) DIN Valve Connectors featuring the addition of Form C and Form Micro housings. Combining IP67 sealing properties with an external-thread design, the mPm DIN valve connector range provides superior cable retention for increased performance and reliability. mPm DIN valve connectors simplify the manufacturing process and reduce overall applied costs for hydraulic, pneumatic and electromagnetic drive systems. The external nut on the Molex mPm DIN valve connector provides greater and consistent torque, which ensures cable retention and high reliability. The mPm DIN connectors achieve a sealing performance from dust and water to IP67. Cable retention force is increased by up to 115% compared to traditional internal nut designs. The innovative new design reduces the number of components in the connector, making customer assembly and secure mounting easier and quicker. The mPmexternal-nut design reduces the number of individual components within the DIN va
