Molex Inc. Introduces SST(TM) DN4 DeviceNet USB Interface Module, High-Performance Solution for Industrial Communication.
Molex Inc. has introduced the SST(TM) DN4 DeviceNet USB interface module to complement its range of SST DN4 DeviceNet Network Interface Cards (NICs). The SST DN4 DeviceNet USB interface module provides industrial OEMs and end-users with a compact, high-performance DeviceNet interface for PC communication that maximizes performance in control and monitoring applications. Like the SST DN4 NICs, the USB interface module uses an enhanced FPGA design with a lower component count, resulting in an extended product lifecycle and higher reliability. Ideal for real-time control and data acquisition applications, which range from PC control and HMI/SCADA systems, network configuration, troubleshooting and diagnostic tools, the Molex DN4 USB interface module provides industrial OEMs and end-users with a more reliable and cost-effective solution for industrial communication. Simultaneous execution of Group 2 Client (Master) and Server (Slave) operations allows the OEM and end-user to implement control schemes where all ca
