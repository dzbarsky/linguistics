Molex Inc. and BridgeLux, Inc. Launch Next Generation of Helieon Light Module.
Molex Inc. and BridgeLux, Inc. introduced the Helieon(R) 120V AC Sustainable Light Module, a next generation modular solid-state lighting solution that connects directly to 120V AC line voltage input. Eliminating the need for external drivers not only dramatically simplifies the design-in process, but also enables more efficient and consistent lighting performance. The Helieon 120V AC module is TRIAC dimmable down to less than 5% and is compatible with a wide range of commercially available dimmers, enabling it to easily interface with many typical electrical installations. In addition to adding the electronic driver functionality, the available product options for the Helieon 120V AC module will be expanded with the introduction of a 2000 operational lumen option and the addition of a 120 degree viewing angle option to complement the 24, 32 and 50 degree options available May 5, 2011. The initial product launch will include 1200 and 2000 lumen performance options in 3000K CCT with 32 and 120 degree viewing a
