Molex Seeks Acquisitions.
Molex Inc. is seeking acquisitions. We have a good pipeline of acquisition opportunities and if you look at the strength of our balance sheet and the work that Dave has been doing with our bank to create additional liquidity as appropriate opportunities come along, we will absolutely continue to make those and the dividend will not restrict our ability to make those acquisitions, Martin Slark, Vice Chairman and CEO of Molex, said.
