Molex Inc. Introduces Standardized Antennas to General Market.
Molex Inc. released a new standard antenna for applications using the 2.4 GHz ISM (industrial, scientific and medical) band and Wi-Fi. The 2.4 GHz band antenna is the first release in a series of Molex standard antennas designed for the industrial, consumer, medical and automotive markets. Based on diverse manufacturing and RF technologies, Molex standard antennas offer high performance and ease of integration for demanding wireless applications. The 2.4 GHz band antenna is based on the market-leading Molex LDS (Laser Direct Structuring) technology. Using a 3D laser system, LDS technology allows the transfer of the antenna from CAD data directly onto a molded antenna carrier or even directly onto the device structure. The 2.4 GHz ISM antenna is fully compatible with surface mount device and reflow processes for smooth product integration with customer processes. The overall size of 3.0mm width by 3.0mm length by 4.0mm height makes the 2.4 GHz ISM one of the smallest on-ground antennas in its class. The antenn
