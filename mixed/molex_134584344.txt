Molex Inc. Releases ClipLok Interconnect Clip.
Molex Inc. recently released the ClipLok(TM) interconnect clip, an electomechanical connection that easily attaches to secure a membrane switch or FPC tail firmly to a printed circuit board, eliminating the need for mating connectors at each point. A first-to-market product, the low-profile ClipLok interconnect clip provides immediate and reliable circuit-to-board connectivity in a range of consumer, medical, networking and telecommunications applications. The latest addition to the Molex line of integrated switch assemblies, the ClipLok interconnect clip offers a less bulky alternative to other circuit-to-board interconnect methods. The mechanical component securely bonds circuits together by means of a spring-type mechanism. Electrical connections are achieved when the switch circuits are wrapped around the edge of the board. Finally, a built-in feature on each ClipLok interconnect clip guides the assembler in the correct placement of the clip and circuit.
