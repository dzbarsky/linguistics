The New York Times Editors' Choice app, which takes advantage of the device's large screen display and video and slideshow capabilities, is free and advertising-supported. In addition the newspaper is planning a full, paid app for iPad as part of its overall paid strategy. The New York Times Editors' Choice app is available for download at the iPad App Store. The Times worked with Medialets to develop the two new ad units that make use of the creative capabilities of the iPad.
