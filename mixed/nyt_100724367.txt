The New York Times Launches Business Day, New Online Business and Technology Section.
The New York Times Company launched a new business section on its Web site (www.nytimes.com), designed to be a major destination for readers seeking the latest business and technology news. Business Day online has been conceived as a business home page, with a design that emphasizes the latest developments and freshest insights throughout the day. The Latest News module at the top of the page pushes a constantly updated feed of business news from The Times and other sources to the user's screen. Another section of the page, 'Insight & Analysis' highlights the unique perspective of Times reporters and columnists, including blog posts, updated throughout the day. A redesign of the Markets module surfaces more markets data on the page, and the site's multimedia packages are featured prominently.
