The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times Announce Distribution Agreement.
The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times announced an agreement in which the Los Angeles Times, a Tribune Publishing company, will begin distribution of The New York Times to home-delivery customers in Southern California. The New York Times offers home delivery in 237 markets across the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, on March 10 The Times will convert its San Diego County home delivery to the Los Angeles Times. At the same time, because of the Los Angeles Times's larger home-delivery reach in San Diego County, The New York Times will become available in 21 additional ZIP codes for a total of 84 ZIP codes throughout the county.
