The New York Times Company will launch Press Engine, a technology and design solution that allows publishers and media organizations to deliver their content across new platforms starting with iPhone and iPad applications, in the fourth quarter of 2010. Through Press Engine, clients will be able to leverage The Times's experience in building acclaimed digital products designed to grow loyal readership, create an expanded subscription model and provide new opportunities for advertisers to reach that loyal readership. The Telegraph Media Group and A.H. Belo Corporation-owned The Dallas Morning News, The Providence Journal and The Press-Enterprise are the first publishers to license Press Engine.
