The New York Times Company to Repay Loan Early.
The New York Times Company plans to pay back a $250 million loan from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim by January 2012, three years early. The company borrowed the $250 million last year, buying time to sell assets and refinance debt. The lenders received six-year notes with a coupon of more than 14% and detachable warrants. The warrants expire in January 2015.
