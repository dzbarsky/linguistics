Atheros Communications Inc. Demonstrates Unprecedented Performance of its Ethernet-over-Coax Solution.
Atheros Communications Inc. demonstrated the unprecedented performance of its Ethernet-over-Coax (EoC) solution for last mile broadband access. Atheros' AR7400 powerline chipset offers PHY rates of 700 Mbps and up to 350 Mbps of actual throughput over coax cables, providing cable operators with a cost-effective way to deliver two-way data services, such as broadband access, interactive TV and video-on-demand, over existing coax infrastructures. The AR7400 complies with the new IEEE 1901 draft standard for powerline networking and interoperates with the vast installed base of HomePlug(r) AV products. Demonstrating the strong global support behind IEEE 1901, Jiangsu Cable Networks (JSCN) and Oriental Cable Networks (OCN), have adopted the standard into their EoC specifications. Both operators will deploy Atheros' EoC technology as they strengthen their infrastructure to support next-generation broadband and digital TV services. The AR7400 is a fourth-generation HomePlug chipset that delivers carrier-grade broad
