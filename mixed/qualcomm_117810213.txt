Atheros Communications Inc. Introduces Two New 802.11n Router Solutions.
"Atheros Communications Inc. announced two highly-integrated 802.11n solutions that bring high-end performance and features to mainstream Wi-Fi(R) routers and residential gateways. The new Align(R) AR933x and XSPAN(R) AR934x system-on-chip (SoC) solutions include all of the major components required to build 1-stream or 2-stream 802.11n routers, respectively. This high level of silicon integration not only enables smaller and more energy-efficient networking products, but also provides manufacturers with a flexible and cost-effective platform for adding advanced wireless connectivity to consumer electronic devices., combining an 802.11n media access controller (MAC), baseband and radio, with a network processor, radio front-end, Ethernet switch, and other components onto a single silicon die. This integration reduces the number of external components required to build Wi-Fi products, enabling smaller and more cost-effective wireless platforms with robust 802.11n performance and advanced features.
