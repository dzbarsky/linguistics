Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Aewin Technologies Co. Ltd. and Atheros Communications Inc. Develops Unified Threat Management Design to Source $100 Original Design Manufacturer Solutions for the Small/Medium Business and Branch Office Markets.
Freescale Semiconductor Inc. has worked with Aewin Technologies Co. Ltd. and Atheros Communications Inc. to develop a unified threat management (UTM) design allowing networking equipment companies to source $100 original design manufacturer (ODM) solutions for the small/medium business (SMB) and branch office markets. Powered by Freescale's QorIQ P1010 processor, the design is intended to help equipment manufacturers create high-performance security products that offer hardware-accelerated security and intrusion prevention services (IPS) at price points previously serviced only by lower-performance, commodity processors. The UTM solution was jointly developed by Freescale and leading ODM Aewin. It incorporates Atheros ETHOS(R) Ethernet components to enable a low-cost security appliance that can deliver two gigabits per second of stateful firewall, and greater than 200 Mbps of IPS. The solution also integrates Freescale's advanced VortiQa security application software. The UTM solution will be available throug
