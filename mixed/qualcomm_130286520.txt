Atheros Communications, Inc. Launches the HomePlug Green PHY Emulation Development Kit.
Atheros Communications, Inc. announced the HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) emulation development kit. The Atheros PL-14 HPGP development kit consists of a hardware platform based on existing HomePlug AV silicon, adapted to support serial peripheral interface (SPI) ports enabling connectivity to a vast family of low-cost and low-energy microcontrollers (MCUs), as well as an emulation firmware and software driver with application programming interfaces (APIs) to support future Atheros Green PHY products. By accurately emulating a Green PHY environment, the development kit enables the company customers to evaluate the technology's capabilities and develop application software for Internet of Things product families focused on smart grid and smart energy. HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) is a subset standard of the widely deployed HomePlug AV powerline standard. The Green PHY specification enables a low-power, low-energy and robust connectivity solution, while supporting data rates up to 10 Mbps for scalable IP connectivity.
