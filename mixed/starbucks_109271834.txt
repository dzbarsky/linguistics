Starbucks Corp. and Ajinomoto General Foods Inc. announced the upcoming launch of a portfolio of new coffee products this autumn into grocery and convenience stores in Japan. This is the first time Starbucks coffee products will be available outside Starbucks retail stores in Japan. Starbucks will launch Starbucks ORIGAMI(R) Personal Drip(TM) coffee, a convenient, single-use pour-over brewing system that allows customers to freshly brew a cup of Starbucks coffee wherever they are. Starbucks VIA(R) Coffee Essence will also be available in grocery and convenience stores. Invoking the artistry and hand-crafted nature of Japan's ancient art of origami, this innovative product allows customers to brew a single cup of Starbucks coffee at home that does not require any special equipment. Starbucks ORIGAMI(R) Personal Drip(TM) coffee is available in three blends; Starbucks(R) House Blend, Breakfast Blend and Espresso Roast, and will be in stores in the Kanto area.
