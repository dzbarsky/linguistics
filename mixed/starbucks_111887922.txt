Starbucks Corp Announces Availability of Starbucks VIA Ready Brew in Philippines.
Starbucks Corp. announced that the Philippines will be the fourth market to offer Starbucks VIA Ready Brew. Starting mid of September 2010, all Starbucks stores in the Philippines will carry Starbucks VIA Ready Brew in Colombia, Italian Roast and Decaffeinated Italian Roast. The Philippines will join Japan as the second country in Asia to offer Starbucks VIA Ready Brew. As a premium-portion stick coffee solution that doesn't require any special equipment, Starbucks VIA is resonating with consumers and meeting untapped demand. Starbucks VIA Ready Brew is made from 100% natural roasted Arabica coffee in an instant and micro ground form that is rich and full bodied in flavor, just like a fresh-brewed cup of Starbucks coffee.
