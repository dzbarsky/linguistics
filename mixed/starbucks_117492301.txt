Court Agrees to Review Kraft Foods and Starbucks Dispute.
Kraft Foods Inc. announced that a federal court in New York has agreed to consider a preliminary injunction it is seeking against Starbucks Corporation. Kraft is challenging the legality of Starbucks' decision to end a 12-year-old contract through which it distributes Starbucks packaged coffee to retailers. Kraft says the deal generates $500 million in sales a year. Starbucks has accused Kraft of failing to uphold its end of the deal and would now prefer to go it alone. The court gave both sides until Jan. 21 to present their positions on the matter. Starbucks said it will halt further coffee supplies to Kraft on Jan. 29, 2011, a move Kraft claims would result in lost sales for its retail customers.
