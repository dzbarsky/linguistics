Starbucks Corporation Launches Mobile Payment in US Company-Operated Stores.
Starbucks Corporation has announced the launch of mobile payment in all US company-operated stores, allowing customers to pay for in-store purchases with select smart phones. Building on the earlier introduction of Starbucks Card Mobile App for select BlackBerry smart phones, iPhone and iPod touch and a mobile payment test program, customers now have access to the mobile payment program in the US. This national program now includes nearly 6,800 company-operated stores and more than 1,000 Starbucks in US target locations.
